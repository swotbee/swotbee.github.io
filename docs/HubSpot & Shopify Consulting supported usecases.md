# HubSpot \& Shopify Consulting Services

Based on extensive research of customer pain points, community discussions, and market demands, here are the most sought-after consulting services for HubSpot and Shopify implementations:

## Top 20 Most Frequently Requested Services

### 1. "Fix Missing Deal-Company Associations from HubSpot-Shopify Integration"

The standard HubSpot-Shopify integration creates deals for every order but fails to associate them with companies, creating major complications for B2B businesses. This service addresses the critical gap where deals exist in isolation without company context, making segmentation, reporting, and analysis nearly impossible. We implement custom workflows and data mapping solutions to automatically associate Shopify orders with the correct companies in HubSpot, ensuring accurate account-based reporting and enabling proper B2B sales tracking. This includes setting up automated processes to handle future orders, creating bulk association tools for existing data, and establishing data validation rules to prevent future disconnects. The result is a seamless flow of e-commerce data that supports sophisticated B2B sales operations and executive decision-making.

### 2. "Clean Up Your Messy HubSpot Database - Data Cleansing That Actually Works"

Dirty data is killing your marketing ROI and sales efficiency. This comprehensive data cleansing service tackles the 30-50% of inaccurate CRM data that's plaguing your HubSpot instance. We systematically identify and fix duplicate records, standardize formatting inconsistencies, remove unengaged contacts, and establish ongoing data hygiene protocols. Using advanced tools and custom workflows, we audit your database for common errors like incomplete contact records, outdated information, spelling mistakes, and non-standardized entries. The service includes setting up automated data validation rules, creating standardized data entry processes for your team, and implementing monitoring systems to maintain data quality over time. Clean data means better segmentation, more accurate reporting, improved email deliverability, and ultimately higher conversion rates across all your marketing and sales activities.

### 3. "Stop Workflow Chaos - Professional HubSpot Automation Setup"

Many businesses create a tangled mess of overlapping workflows that confuse contacts and frustrate teams. This service redesigns your automation architecture from the ground up, implementing clear naming conventions, logical enrollment criteria, and proper unenrollment rules. We audit existing workflows to identify conflicts, redundancies, and gaps, then rebuild them with sustainable, scalable logic. The service includes creating workflow documentation, establishing testing protocols, and training your team on best practices. We focus on building workflows around customer lifecycle stages rather than individual campaigns, ensuring contacts receive coherent, contextual communication throughout their journey. The result is automation that actually works - reducing manual tasks, improving customer experience, and providing reliable, predictable outcomes that support your business goals.

### 4. "Build Reports That Actually Answer Your Business Questions"

HubSpot's reporting limitations frustrate users who need answers beyond basic metrics. This service creates custom reporting solutions that provide real business insights, including cross-object reporting, advanced attribution modeling, and executive dashboards. We design reports that track the metrics that matter to your business, from lead source ROI to sales pipeline velocity to customer lifetime value. The service includes setting up automated reporting schedules, creating user-specific dashboards for different roles, and establishing KPI tracking that aligns with your business objectives. We also address common reporting challenges like data discrepancies, filter limitations, and the inability to combine certain data sources. The end result is a reporting ecosystem that empowers data-driven decision making at every level of your organization.

### 5. "Lead Scoring That Actually Predicts Sales-Ready Prospects"

Many businesses struggle with lead scoring that either flags too many unqualified leads or misses genuine opportunities. This service implements a sophisticated, multi-factor lead scoring system that accurately identifies sales-ready prospects based on your specific business model and customer journey. We analyze your historical conversion data to identify the behaviors and characteristics that truly predict purchase intent, then build scoring models that weight these factors appropriately. The service includes setting up separate scoring for different product lines or customer segments, implementing score decay to maintain relevance, and creating automated workflows that trigger appropriate sales actions based on score thresholds. We also establish feedback loops between sales and marketing to continuously refine scoring accuracy based on actual outcomes.

Poorly structured sales pipelines create forecasting nightmares and hide revenue opportunities.

We audit your current pipeline performance, identify bottlenecks and leakage points, then restructure stages to provide better visibility and control. The service includes setting up automated stage progression rules, creating pipeline-specific reports and dashboards, and establishing sales coaching tools based on pipeline data. We also implement deal scoring and pipeline hygiene workflows to maintain data accuracy. The result is a pipeline that provides reliable forecasting, identifies coaching opportunities, and enables consistent revenue growth through better sales process management and opportunity tracking.

### 7. "Track Every Sales Activity - No More 'Did You Call That Lead?' Questions"
