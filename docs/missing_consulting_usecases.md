### 1. "Fix Missing Deal-Company Associations from HubSpot-Shopify Integration"

The standard HubSpot-Shopify integration creates deals for every order but fails to associate them with companies, creating major complications for B2B businesses.

We implement custom workflows and data mapping solutions to automatically associate Shopify orders with the correct companies in HubSpot, ensuring accurate account-based reporting and enabling proper B2B sales tracking. This includes setting up automated processes to handle future orders, creating bulk association tools for existing data, and establishing data validation rules to prevent future disconnects. The result is a seamless flow of e-commerce data that supports sophisticated B2B sales operations and executive decision-making.
