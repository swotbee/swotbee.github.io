## HubSpot Adoption by Industry (Based on HubSpot’s Customer Data)

Instead, we reference Thomson Data’s concise breakdown of HubSpot customers by industry, which provides authoritative, up-to-date figures. Below are 30 industries—10 with exact counts and 20 additional sectors known to widely adopt HubSpot—illustrating the breadth of HubSpot’s usage. The counts reflect the number of organizations in each industry using HubSpot.
