# Marketing Automation: Next 25 Unique Items

## Problems (Next 25)

1. **Integrating legacy systems**
Difficulty connecting modern automation platforms with outdated on-premise CRM or ERP systems, causing data inconsistencies.
2. **Content production bottlenecks**
Lack of scalable content creation processes slows down automation campaign launches.
3. **Underutilization of platform features**
Teams often stick to basic email sends, neglecting advanced capabilities like dynamic content and predictive scoring[^1].
4. **Complex attribution modeling**
Inability to accurately attribute conversions across multi-touch customer journeys due to limited analytics setup[^2].
5. **High vendor churn risk**
Frequent platform switches because initial tool selections fail to meet evolving business needs.
6. **Shadow automations**
Unapproved workflows built in siloed teams leading to fragmented experiences and governance gaps[^3].
7. **Inaccessible real-time data**
Delayed data syncing between automation and BI tools prevents timely decision-making[^4].
8. **Excessive manual overrides**
Reliance on manual edits in automated sequences reduces scalability and increases error risk.
9. **Poor mobile UX in landing pages**
Automated landing pages not optimized for mobile result in high abandonment rates.
10. **Inefficient form-to-CRM data flows**
Complex mapping and formatting errors when pushing form leads into CRM records[^5].
11. **Limited multilingual support**
Inability to serve global audiences with localized workflows and content hampers international growth.
12. **Lack of automated error-handling**
Workflows fail silently without fallback actions or alerts, causing data loss.
13. **Ignoring behavioral decay**
Not re-scoring contacts after inactivity leads to stale targeting and wasted sends.
14. **Overly complex decision splits**
Nested if/else branches become unmaintainable, leading to unintended contact paths.
15. **Failure to archive retired workflows**
Old automations clutter dashboards, causing confusion and maintenance overhead.
16. **Vendor roadmap misalignment**
Platform feature releases don’t align with organizational needs; no visibility into upcoming changes[^6].
17. **No change management process**
Lack of formal review and approval for workflow updates leads to uncoordinated rollouts.
18. **Unclear success metrics**
Teams launch automations without defined KPIs, making performance assessment impossible.
19. **Poor cross-channel reporting**
Inability to view combined email, SMS, and social metrics in one dashboard.
20. **Inadequate server capacity planning**
Spike in sends overwhelms infrastructure, causing batch failures.
21. **Security vulnerabilities in integrations**
Exposed API keys and webhook endpoints create data breach risks.
22. **Absence of user access audits**
No regular reviews of user permissions leads to unauthorized workflow edits.
23. **Failure to leverage AI insights**
Ignoring AI-driven predictive analytics hinders advanced segmentation[^7].
24. **Neglecting consent management**
No automated consent renewal campaigns for GDPR/CCPA, risking non-compliance.
25. **Lack of taxonomy governance**
Inconsistent naming conventions for segments, tags, and workflows impede search and reuse.
