# Marketing Automation: Next 25 Unique Items

## Problems (Next 25)

1. **Difficulty scaling personalization**
Personalization efforts that work at small scale often fail when applied to millions of contacts, leading to generic messaging and disengaged audiences.
2. **Unclear governance roles**
Lack of defined ownership for workflows causes confusion over who can build, edit, or approve automations, leading to duplicate or conflicting sequences.
3. **Failure to leverage predictive content**
Ignoring AI-driven content recommendations prevents marketers from surfacing the best assets to each segment, reducing relevance.
4. **Poor alignment of KPIs and incentives**
When marketing is rewarded on volume metrics but automation aims for quality engagement, teams may game the system with superficial campaigns.
5. **Siloed reporting**
Separate dashboards for email, SMS, and ads hinder understanding of cross-channel performance and obscure holistic optimization opportunities.
6. **Inadequate security and compliance monitoring**
Neglecting automated scans for data leaks, permission changes, or misconfigured forms risks breaches and regulatory violations.
7. **Complex user permission structures**
Overly granular or inconsistent permission settings frustrate admins and slow down necessary edits to live workflows.
8. **Inefficient vendor management**
Onboarding multiple automation vendors without standardized evaluation criteria leads to feature overlap, licensing waste, and integration headaches.
9. **Lack of real-time behavior scoring**
Failing to update lead scores instantly when customers take key actions delays handoffs to sales or high-value triggers.
10. **Neglecting internal stakeholder communication**
Not automating updates or change logs for internal teams causes misalignment, duplicated work, and missed launch deadlines.
11. **Insufficient load testing**
Ignoring performance under peak volumes results in delayed sends or failures when campaigns hit thousands of concurrent triggers.
12. **Empathy gap in automated messaging**
Purely data-driven triggers can send tone-deaf messages during crises or outages, damaging brand trust.
13. **Overly rigid naming conventions**
Forcing inflexible asset names prevents descriptive context and hinders discoverability as needs evolve.
14. **Failure to automate internal approvals**
Manual sign-offs for every workflow change create bottlenecks and reduce agility in fast-moving campaigns.
15. **Inconsistent fallback messaging**
Not providing default content when personalization data is missing leads to broken emails or blank fields.
16. **Ignoring negative feedback loops**
Failing to automate suppression of segments reporting spam or unsubscribes perpetuates deliverability damage.
17. **No automated conversion timing optimization**
Not using data-driven send time stamps for high-value flows misses incremental engagement lift.
18. **Failure to retire outdated assets**
Old templates and workflows remain in libraries, cluttering builder interfaces and confusing users.
19. **Vendor over-customization risk**
Excessive reliance on proprietary vendor features without fallback strategies hinders future migration.
20. **Underuse of webhook-based notifications**
Not sending real-time alerts to Slack or Teams for critical events (e.g., high-value form fills) delays responses.
21. **Insufficient tagging taxonomy**
Poorly structured tags on contacts, forms, and emails complicate segmentation and reporting.
22. **Lack of automated campaign pausing**
No rules to pause underperforming or risky campaigns (e.g., during major outages) leads to wasted spend and potential customer annoyance.
23. **Missing progressive delivery**
Sending to entire lists at once without phased rollouts can trigger ISP throttling or bounce spikes.
24. **Failure to automate SLA tracking**
Not monitoring response times for lead handoffs to sales leads to SLA breaches and interdepartmental friction.
25. **Ignoring AI hallucinations**
Blindly using AI-generated content without validation risks publishing factually incorrect or brand-inconsistent messaging.
