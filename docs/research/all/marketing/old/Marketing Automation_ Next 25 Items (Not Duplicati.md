# Marketing Automation: Next 25 Items (Not Duplicating Prior 25)

## Problems (Next 25)

1. **Choosing the wrong automation platform**
Selecting a tool misaligned with scale or feature needs leads to wasted budget and stalled workflows[^1].
2. **Budget and resource constraints**
Limited budgets restrict tool selection and staffing, delaying implementations and feature rollouts[^2].
3. **Inadequate employee skillsets**
Teams lacking technical or strategic know-how struggle to configure and optimize workflows[^2].
4. **Lack of relevant content**
Absence of fresh, valuable content stalls nurture campaigns and reduces engagement[^2].
5. **Integration failures**
Disconnected systems (CRM, analytics, CMS) cause data silos and manual workarounds[^3].
6. **Overcomplicated system configurations**
Excessive custom rules and nested conditions make maintenance error-prone and workflows brittle[^1].
7. **Failure to implement progressive profiling**
Not capturing incremental profile data over time prevents deeper personalization later[^4].
8. **Lack of behavioral triggers**
Workflows without real-time triggers miss opportunities to act on key customer actions (e.g., cart abandonment)[^5].
9. **Neglecting mobile optimization**
Non-mobile-friendly emails and landing pages cause poor engagement on smartphones and tablets[^4].
10. **Underutilized pre-built templates and wizards**
Reinventing basic flows instead of leveraging vendor templates increases setup time and errors[^6].
11. **Ignoring compliance workflows**
Failing to automate consent and data-retention policies elevates legal risk and erodes trust[^2].
12. **Single-channel focus**
Sole reliance on email neglects SMS, web push, and social retargeting channels that boost conversion[^7].
13. **Poor form design and lead capture**
Long forms and no social sign-on cause drop-offs and incomplete profiles[^4].
14. **Insufficient split-testing beyond emails**
Not A/B testing landing pages, CTAs, or send windows limits optimization potential[^4].
15. **Ignoring data decay**
No automated purges of stale or inactive contacts inflates lists and decreases deliverability[^8].
16. **No fallback paths in workflows**
Missing “else” branches leave contacts stranded if they don’t meet expected criteria[^1].
17. **Inadequate real-time analytics integration**
Delayed data feeds into dashboards prevent agile decision making[^9].
18. **Homogenized AI-generated content**
Over-reliance on AI stifles brand voice distinctiveness and lowers engagement[^10].
19. **Lack of cross-department governance**
No shared naming conventions or documentation causes overlapping or conflicting automations[^8].
20. **Ignoring post-purchase loyalty journeys**
Focusing only on acquisition overlooks churn prevention and advocacy[^5].
21. **No pilot or phased rollout**
Launching enterprise-wide automations without proof-of-concept increases failure risk[^11].
22. **Misconfigured lead scoring thresholds**
Unrealistic point values flood sales with unqualified leads or starve them of opportunities[^7].
23. **Unavailable vendor support utilization**
Not engaging support or training resources prolongs ramp-up time and misconfigurations[^6].
24. **Neglecting multi-language localization**
Templates and content not adapted for global audiences hamper international expansion[^12].
25. **Budget constraints on testing**
Limited budget for multivariate tests prevents discovering highest-performing variants[^2].
