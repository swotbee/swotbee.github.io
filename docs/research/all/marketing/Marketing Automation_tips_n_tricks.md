## Problems (Next 25)

1. **Overemphasis on Technology Over Strategy**
Focusing on tool capabilities rather than business objectives leads to misaligned automations and wasted spend[^1].
2. **Vendor Lock-In and Migration Risk**
Being tied to a single platform without exit plans complicates switching vendors and incurs data portability issues[^2].

Not alerting teams to critical events (e.g., high-value lead capture) delays responses[^6].
19. **Underutilized Template and Library Assets**
Rebuilding basic elements from scratch wastes time and increases error rates[^4].
20. **Ignoring Compliance Roadmap Visibility**
Lack of vendor transparency on upcoming features impedes planning for legal requirements[^7].
