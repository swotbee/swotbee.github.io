**Before:**

1. Document “as-is” processes with swimlane diagrams (Flowwright)[^4]
2. Identify repetitive tasks suitable for automation (Flowwright)[^4]
3. Define clear error-handling and fallback paths (Lonti)[^5]

**After:**

1. Break monolithic flows into reusable subflows (Lonti)[^5]
2. Refactor conditional logic into separate decision services (Flowwright)[^4]
3. Implement version control and change-review checkpoints (Lonti)[^5]

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

**After:**

1. Send notifications via email, SMS, or chat (Codeless Platforms)[^6]
2. Log delivery statuses to audit tables (Codeless Platforms)[^6]
3. Enable escalation paths for unacknowledged alerts (Azure API Center)[^7]

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

1. Implement real-time dashboards for monitoring alert health (Azure API Center)[^7]
2. Automate retry logic with exponential back-off on failures (Codeless Platforms)[^6]
3. Route critical alerts into incident-management systems (Azure API Center)[^7]

## Item: Poor Mobile Experience

Type: Problem
Workflow reference: “Key Challenges for Mobile Test Automation and Their Solutions” (PixelQA)[^9]

Most common position: QA and UAT phase, after feature development and before release.

**Ways to reach this task:**

1. Fragmented device-OS coverage in test suites (PixelQA)[^9]
2. Neglected offline mode and context-awareness (Cigniti)[^10]
3. Low-priority mobile UX fixes deferred to post-launch (BrowserStack)[^11]

**Before:**

1. Define target device matrix based on user demographics (PixelQA)[^9]
2. Create test plans for online/offline and orientation changes (Cigniti)[^10]
3. Prioritize performance and memory-usage benchmarks (BrowserStack)[^11]

**After:**

1. Automate UI tests across cloud device farms (PixelQA)[^9]
2. Conduct real-user condition testing (BrowserStack)[^11]
3. Iterate on UX feedback via beta testing programs (BrowserStack)[^11]

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

1. Integrate mobile analytics SDKs for crash and performance monitoring (PixelQA)[^9]
2. Roll out phased updates focusing on the worst-performing devices first (BrowserStack)[^11]
3. Provide in-app feedback channels to capture user pain points (PixelQA)[^9]

## Item: Over-Automation Risk

Type: Problem
Workflow reference: “Over-Automation in Digital Marketing: The Hidden Risk to Customer Loyalty” (Ripple Solutions)[^12]

Most common position: Campaign execution phase, after workflow design and before multi-channel rollout.
