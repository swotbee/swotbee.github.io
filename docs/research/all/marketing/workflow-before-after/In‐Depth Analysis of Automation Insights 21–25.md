## Item: Security Vulnerabilities in Integrations

Type: Problem
Workflow reference: “Third-Party API Integration Best Practices” (AppSentinels)

Most common position: *Integration testing phase*, immediately after connector configuration and before production go-live.

**Ways to reach this task:**

1. Static credential usage in API calls [AppSentinels]

1. Define integration endpoints and authentication methods (OAuth, API keys) [Curity]
2. Document expected request/response schemas with JSON schema validation [Security Compass]
3. Configure rate-limiting and throttling rules in API gateway [AppSentinels]

**After:**

1. Enable detailed logging of API requests, errors, and access failures [Security Compass]
2. Conduct automated vulnerability scans against API endpoints [Security Compass]
3. Patch or rotate compromised credentials and enforce token expiration [AppSentinels]

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

1. Implement RBAC and ABAC controls at API layer [Security Compass]
2. Automate anomaly detection with SIEM alerts on unusual patterns [Security Compass]
3. Schedule periodic pen-tests and compliance audits of integrations [AppSentinels]

## Item: Absence of User Access Audits

Type: Problem
Workflow reference: “User Access Review: What Is It, Best Practices \& Checklist” (Syteca)

2. Assign data owners or business owners to perform reviews [Tenfold]
3. Automate collection of current access entitlements across systems [Tenfold]

**After:**

3. Adjust IAM role definitions to enforce least-privilege going forward [Syteca]

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

1. Deploy continuous access monitoring tools for real-time alerts [Syteca]
2. Integrate access-review workflows into ITSM or GRC platforms [Tenfold]
3. Automate remediation tickets for exceptions via workflow engine [Syteca]

## Item: Failure to Leverage AI Insights

Type: Tip
Workflow reference: “Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Marketing Automation” (ToTheNew)

Most common position: *Post-deployment optimization phase*, immediately after basic reporting and before advanced campaign tuning.

**Ways to reach this task:**

1. Ignoring built-in AI recommendations in campaign dashboards [Sitecore]
2. Relying solely on manual segmentation and scoring rules [ToTheNew]
3. Viewing AI modules as “black-box” rather than exploring use cases [Demandbase]

**Before:**

1. Configure basic metrics collection (opens, clicks, conversions) [Sitecore]
2. Enable AI modules (predictive scoring, content recommendations) in platform settings [ToTheNew]
3. Map customer attributes to AI-model inputs [Sitecore]

**After:**

1. Review AI-powered lead-score distributions alongside manual scores [Demandbase]
2. Incorporate AI recommendations into A/B test hypotheses [Sitecore]
3. Retrain or tune AI models based on conversion outcomes [ToTheNew]

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

1. Automate dynamic content insertion driven by AI propensity scores [Sitecore]
2. Use AI-driven predictive analytics to adjust campaign budgets in real time [Demandbase]
3. Deploy chatbots and virtual assistants trained on customer intents [ToTheNew]

## Item: Neglecting Consent Management Workflows

Type: Problem
Workflow reference: “Creating a Consent Management Workflow” (HIVO)

Most common position: *Pre-send compliance phase*, immediately after contact capture and before marketing sends.

**Ways to reach this task:**

1. Deploying tracking pixels before capturing explicit consent [Privasapien]
2. Importing contact lists without consent flags into campaigns [Privasapien]
3. Skipping preference-center implementation on landing pages [HIVO]

**Before:**

1. Identify all touchpoints where personal data is collected (forms, APIs) [HIVO]
2. Configure consent categories and corresponding suppression lists [Privasapien]
3. Integrate CMP banners or modals and capture user choices [HIVO]

**After:**

1. Suppress or exclude non-consented profiles from campaign sends [HIVO]
2. Log and timestamp consent events in audit tables [Privasapien]
3. Trigger automated re-consent flows upon regulation updates [Privasapien]

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

1. Automate periodic re-consent reminders based on policy lifecycles [Privasapien]
2. Expose consent status via unified dashboards for marketing and compliance [HIVO]
3. Embed consent checks into downstream data workflows (export, enrichment) [HIVO]

## Item: Lack of Taxonomy Governance

Type: Problem
Workflow reference: “Taxonomy Governance | Enterprise Taxonomy” (Taxonomy Strategies)

Most common position: *Maintenance phase*, immediately after taxonomy rollout and before iterative updates.

**Ways to reach this task:**

1. Publishing uncontrolled naming conventions across teams [Taxonomy Strategies]
2. Ad hoc category additions by business units without oversight [Factor]
3. Multiple taxonomy versions living in siloed systems [Factor]

**Before:**

1. Establish governance committee roles (stewards, editors) [Taxonomy Strategies]

3. Define value statements and success metrics for taxonomy use [Factor]

**After:**

1. Conduct quarterly governance reviews to approve change requests [Taxonomy Strategies]
2. Update taxonomy artifacts (labels, hierarchies) based on usage analytics [Factor]
3. Communicate changes via versioned release notes to stakeholders [Taxonomy Strategies]

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

1. Automate taxonomy change notifications and approval workflows [Taxonomy Strategies]
2. Integrate taxonomy governance into CMS and DAM workflows for enforcement [Factor]
