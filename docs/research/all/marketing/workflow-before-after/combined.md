Workflow reference: “Customer Lifetime Value: The Secret to Boosting Your Revenue” (Mapp Marketing Cloud)[^6]

Most common position: Post-implementation review phase, immediately after short-term ROI analysis and before budget planning cycles.

**Ways to reach this task:**

1. Measuring only campaign-level metrics (opens, clicks) without revenue context [Salesforce CLV guide][^7]
2. Calculating ROI on acquisition costs while ignoring retention value [Act-On CLV guide][^8]

1. Aggregate immediate revenue and cost data post-campaign (Mapp TEI study)[^6]
2. Populate short-term conversion reports in dashboards (Salesforce)[^7]
3. Define CAC and one-time campaign ROI metrics (Act-On)[^8]

**After:**

1. Missed insights into customer retention and upsell revenue (Mapp)[^6]

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

1. Automate CLV calculations in CDP or CRM with daily refreshes (Salesforce)[^7]
2. Build CLV dashboards for segmentation and budget reallocation (MetricsWatch)[^11]
3. Integrate predictive CLV models into campaign triggers for high-value customers (Custobar)[^12]

3. Choose initial attribution model (first, last, linear) in reporting tool [Salesforce India][^1]

**After:**

1. Analyze channel contributions and adjust budget allocations [Salesforce India][^1]
2. Iterate on model by testing time-decay or U-shaped credit splits [Adobe][^3]
