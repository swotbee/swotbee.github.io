# Marketing Automation: Next 25 Unique Items

## Problems (Next 25)

1. **Inconsistent multi-touch attribution**
Difficulty reconciling offline interactions (events, sales calls) with online automation data leads to incomplete ROI analysis.
2. **Lack of real-time personalization at scale**
Systems struggle to process large volumes of behavioral data quickly, resulting in stale or generic messaging.
3. **Fragmented user profiles**
Contacts scattered across multiple systems (CRM, CDP, helpdesk) prevent unified journey orchestration.
4. **Rigid workflow templates**
Vendor-provided templates that can’t be customized to specific business rules force workarounds and manual edits.
5. **Poor segmentation maintenance**
Static lists become outdated without automation to add/remove contacts based on evolving criteria.
6. **Overly aggressive send cadences**
Fixed-frequency campaigns ignore individual engagement levels, increasing unsubscribes and complaints.
7. **Difficulty validating data compliance**
Hard to audit which contacts have valid consent flags when data resides in disconnected tables.
8. **Insufficient alerting for workflow failures**
Automation errors (API timeouts, misconfigurations) go unnoticed without proactive error notifications.
9. **Lack of unified campaign visualization**
Marketers can’t see an integrated view of email, SMS, push, and ad sequences in one canvas.
10. **Overdependence on manual QA**
Heavy reliance on human testing for every change creates bottlenecks and delays.
11. **Ignoring contact fatigue signals**
No automated throttle when recipients receive too many messages across channels in a given period.
12. **Failure to track long-term customer value**
Automations optimized for immediate conversions overlook lifetime revenue and retention metrics.
13. **Rigid approval hierarchies**
Multi-tier manual approvals for each workflow change hinder agility and rapid iteration.
14. **Inadequate automation documentation**
Sparse or outdated playbooks leave new team members unable to understand existing flows.
15. **Unaddressed cross-channel suppressions**
Contacts unsubscribing in one channel continue to receive messages in others due to siloed suppression lists.
16. **No rollback capability**
Inability to revert workflow changes automatically forces manual recreation after errors.
17. **Lack of high-volume send testing**
Skipping load tests for large campaigns leads to unexpected throttling or delivery failures.
18. **Inaccurate subscriber activity tracking**
Missing events (email opens, SMS deliveries) due to integration lapses compromise engagement metrics.
19. **Underutilized API-based data enrichment**
Not auto-populating forms or profiles with third-party data leaves records incomplete.
20. **Neglecting accessibility standards**
Emails and landing pages not optimized for screen readers or contrast impede compliance and UX.
21. **Poor error-handling branching**
Workflows abruptly end or loop incorrectly when contacts don’t meet expected criteria.
22. **Limited A/B test automation beyond email**
Not programmatically running multivariate or geo-split tests on landing pages and ad copy.
23. **Failure to align campaign and transactional messaging**
Separate systems for marketing and transactional emails create inconsistent timing and branding.
24. **No dynamic channel preference management**
Contacts’ preferred communication channels aren’t captured or respected automatically.
25. **Difficulty integrating offline event data**
Inability to feed trade show or in-person event interactions into digital nurture sequences.
