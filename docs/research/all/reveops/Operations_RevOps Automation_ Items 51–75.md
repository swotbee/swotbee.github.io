# Operations/RevOps Automation: Items 51–75

## Problems (Items 51–75)

51. **Process Visibility Gaps**
Lack of end-to-end process monitoring means failures often go unnoticed until downstream systems break.
52. **Metric Misalignment**
KPIs for automation often focus on technical uptime rather than business outcome, obscuring true value.
53. **Data Context Loss**
Automated handoffs strip contextual metadata, forcing manual reconciliation when investigating issues.
54. **Shadow Automations**
Unvetted scripts developed by individual users bypass governance, creating hidden failure points.
55. **API Rate Limits**
High-volume integrations hit service quotas, triggering throttling and workflow stalls.
56. **Suboptimal Scheduling**
Rigid cron-style triggers fail to accommodate variable workloads, leading to idle resources or overloads.
57. **Inefficient Resource Utilization**
Bots and servers run at fixed capacities rather than scaling to demand, wasting compute.
58. **Incomplete Dependency Mapping**
Undocumented inter-process dependencies cause cascading failures when one component changes.
59. **Error Recovery Gaps**
Lack of standardized rollback mechanisms forces complex manual restores after failures.
60. **Poor Exception Reporting**
Unstructured error logs impede root-cause analysis and slow remediation.
61. **Licensing Mismanagement**
Over-provisioned or under-utilized automation tool licenses inflate costs without delivering value.
62. **Platform Upgrade Breakages**
Major version upgrades to automation platforms frequently break custom connectors and scripts.
63. **Insufficient Stakeholder Engagement**
Critical business stakeholders are excluded from design phases, leading to misaligned requirements.
64. **Undocumented Edge Case Logic**
Rare exception handling paths are unrecorded, complicating maintenance when incidents occur.
65. **Non-Deterministic Workflows**
Randomized processing orders in parallel automations cause unpredictable outcomes and race conditions.
66. **UI Automation Fragility**
Screen-scraping bots fail with slightest UI changes, triggering regular breakages.
67. **Hard-Coded Configurations**
Embedding environment-specific settings in scripts prevents reuse across test, staging, and production.
68. **Vendor Lock-In Risks**
Heavy reliance on proprietary connectors makes platform migrations prohibitively expensive.
69. **Underestimated Complexity**
Simplistic ROI models ignore the true cost of exception handling and maintenance overhead.
70. **Delayed Incident Response**
Lack of real-time alerts means teams often learn of failures from end-users rather than monitoring tools.
71. **Mono-Skilled Teams**
Automation workloads concentrated on specialized engineers create bottlenecks and knowledge silos.
72. **Ineffective Pilot Programs**
Small-scale pilots fail to replicate production variance, leading to unanticipated issues at scale.
73. **Too Many Manual Checkpoints**
Excess human approvals in automated pipelines negate speed gains and introduce delays.
74. **Overlooked SLAs**
Automations ignore external service level agreements, causing contractual breaches when dependencies lag.
75. **Incomplete Audit Trails**
Missing chronological records for automated changes hamper compliance reviews and forensic investigations.
