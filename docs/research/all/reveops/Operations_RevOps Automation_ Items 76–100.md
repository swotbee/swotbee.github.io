# Operations/RevOps Automation: Items 76–100

## Problems (Items 76–100)

76. **Batch Window Constraints**
Overnight or off-peak batch windows limit data freshness and delay critical reporting.
77. **Unmanaged Technical Debt**
Quick-fix automations accumulate outdated scripts and workarounds, increasing fragility.
78. **Opaque Cost Allocation**
Difficulty attributing automation infrastructure expenses to specific teams obscures budgeting.
79. **Siloed Alerting Mechanisms**
Different tools generate uncoordinated alerts, leading to alert fatigue and missed incidents.
80. **Insufficient Disaster Recovery Automation**
Lack of scripted failover procedures prolongs downtime during outages.
81. **Vendor Ecosystem Fragmentation**
Diverse connectors from multiple vendors introduce compatibility and versioning conflicts.
82. **Hard-to-Debug Parallelism Issues**
Concurrent workflows introduce race conditions that are difficult to trace and resolve.
83. **Immutable Infrastructure Limitations**
Rigid infrastructure provisioning delays urgent capacity needs for automation workloads.
84. **Poor Segregation of Duties**
Automation roles and permissions overlap, violating compliance mandates and audit standards.
85. **Manual Data Reconciliation Reliance**
Persistent need for human checks on automated outputs undermines throughput gains.
86. **Lack of Resilience Testing**
Absence of simulated failure tests leaves workflows untested under adverse conditions.
87. **Legacy Protocol Dependencies**
Reliance on outdated communication protocols (e.g., SOAP, FTP) complicates modern integration.
88. **Unclear Ownership Models**
Ambiguous responsibility for automated processes leads to maintenance gaps and finger-pointing.
89. **Inconsistent Data Latency**
Variable delays in data ingestion break synchronization and downstream analytics.
90. **Complex Licensing Models**
Per-bot, per-user, and per-job licensing schemes create unpredictable cost structures.
91. **Misconfigured Access Controls**
Excessive privileges on service accounts expose automation to security breaches.
92. **Overengineering Simple Tasks**
Applying heavy automation frameworks to trivial tasks increases overhead unnecessarily.
93. **Lack of Runbook Automation**
Critical incident response procedures remain manual, slowing recovery post-failure.
94. **Geographic Data Residency Issues**
Automations spanning regions violate local data sovereignty regulations without proper controls.
95. **Delayed SLA Feedback Loops**
Long feedback cycles between operations and business teams prevent agile improvements.
96. **Erratic External Service Dependencies**
Third-party API instability causes intermittent failures in critical workflows.
97. **Sparse Observability Instrumentation**
Key metrics and traces are missing, hindering proactive performance tuning.
98. **Fragmented Approval Flows**
Multiple disjointed approval systems add latency and increase risk of missed sign-offs.
99. **Underutilized Automation Assets**
Orphaned workflows run infrequently or never, wasting license spend and compute.
100. **Feature Creep in Automations**
Continuous addition of non-core features bloats workflows and complicates maintenance.
