# Operations/RevOps Automation: Items 176–200

## Problems (Items 176–200)

176. **Inconsistent API Schemas**
Upstream services change field names or data types without notification, breaking downstream automations.
177. **Shadow Data Stores**
Teams create isolated data marts outside governed systems, leading to conflicting “truth” sources.
178. **Lack of Orchestration Visibility**
No centralized view of scheduled, running, and failed workflows impedes capacity planning.
179. **Singleton Bot Architectures**
Monolithic bot scripts handle multiple processes, creating unmaintainable spaghetti logic.
180. **Overly Granular Alerts**
Chemically precise error notifications overwhelm teams, masking critical failures.
181. **Frozen Dev Environments**
Stale test beds mirror outdated production, preventing accurate pre-release validations.
182. **Insufficient ML Model Monitoring**
Automated AI decisions lack drift detection, generating degraded outputs over time.
183. **Hardcoded Retry Counts**
Fixed retry loops ignore context, either flooding systems or failing prematurely.
184. **Manual SLA Audits**
Periodic human reviews of SLA compliance slow feedback, delaying remediations.
185. **Language \& Encoding Mismatches**
Multilingual data pipelines choke on character-set inconsistencies, halting downstream flows.
186. **Nonexistent Rollback Playbooks**
Release failures require ad hoc recoveries lacking standardized procedures.
187. **Excessive Feature Dependencies**
Minor process changes trigger rebuilds of large modular libraries, slowing iterations.
188. **Event Storming Complexity**
Hundreds of event types generate entangled subscribers, amplifying maintenance overhead.
189. **Uncoordinated Bot Updates**
Independent versioning across scripts causes incompatible rollouts and runtime errors.
190. **Noisy Data Streams**
Unfiltered telemetry floods monitoring systems, obscuring genuine performance anomalies.
191. **Static Resource Reservations**
Pre-allocated compute slots remain idle off-peak, wasting cloud budgets.
192. **Inadequate Disaster Recovery Tests**
Annual failover drills don’t simulate realistic load, giving false confidence in DR plans.
193. **Protocol Evolution Misalignment**
Emerging standards (gRPC, AMQP) outpace legacy connectors, hindering modernization.
194. **Missing Business Context Tags**
Workflows lack metadata linking executions to business units or projects, preventing chargebacks.
195. **Unmanaged Concurrent Jobs**
High parallelism without throttling causes resource thrashing and service degradation.
196. **Overzealous Dependency Upgrades**
Automatic library updates introduce breaking changes into production pipelines.
197. **Poor Data Partitioning**
Single-shard processing creates hotspots and throttles throughput under heavy workloads.
198. **Inflexible Approval Workflows**
Rigid human gates block low-risk tasks, undermining end-to-end automation.
199. **Lack of Multi-Tenancy Controls**
Shared automation environments expose data across business units, violating isolation needs.
200. **Undocumented Process Decommissioning**
Retiring obsolete workflows leaves dangling triggers and stale credentials in systems.
