# Operations/RevOps Automation: Items 101–125

## Problems (Items 101–125)

101. **Intermittent Data Drift**
Automated models and enrichment routines degrade over time as source data evolves, causing inconsistent outputs.
102. **Immutable Storage Limits**
Write-once, read-many storage policies prevent updates to archived process artifacts for audit corrections.
103. **Asynchronous Workflow Deadlocks**
Uncoordinated parallel jobs can enter circular wait states when dependencies aren’t strictly ordered.
104. **Lack of API Observability**
Insufficient tracing on integration endpoints obscures slow or failing calls within chained workflows.
105. **Transient Resource Failures**
Short-lived infrastructure glitches (e.g., spot-instance interruptions) unexpectedly halt running automations.
106. **Data Schema Evolution**
Upstream schema changes (e.g., renamed fields) break downstream automation scripts that assume fixed models.
107. **Excessive Notification Noise**
Too many non-critical alerts desensitize teams, causing real issues to be overlooked.
108. **Undocumented Runtime Parameters**
Critical flags and toggles aren’t recorded in runbooks, leading to unpredictable behavior in different environments.
109. **Cross-Region Latency Variability**
Geo-distributed workloads experience uneven performance, impacting SLA adherence for global processes.
110. **Licensing Audit Failures**
Compliance audits flag unauthorized or expired automation tool usage due to decentralized license tracking.
111. **Orphaned Dependency Libraries**
Leftover code modules from deprecated workflows create hidden vulnerabilities and maintenance burden.
112. **Non-Idempotent Operations**
Workflows that don’t tolerate replays or retries result in duplicate side effects and data errors.
113. **Manual Configuration Sprawl**
Ad hoc environment tweaks by engineers lead to divergent test, staging, and production behaviors.
114. **Token Expiry Handling**
Expired service credentials cause silent failures in long-running automation flows.
115. **Inconsistent Localization**
Hard-coded locale settings break processes when handling multi-language or region-specific data.
116. **Poorly Scoped Permissions**
Overly broad automation service roles expose systems to privilege escalation and security risk.
117. **Workflow Interference**
Concurrent automations inadvertently modify shared records, resulting in race conditions and data corruption.
118. **Flaky Third-Party Integrations**
Unstable external APIs or webhooks lead to intermittent automation failures that are hard to reproduce.
119. **Silent Error Swallowing**
Catch-all exception handlers hide critical errors, delaying detection and resolution.
120. **Unvalidated Input Sources**
Lack of input sanitization for external feeds exposes automations to malformed or malicious data.
121. **Bot Licensing Exhaustion**
Peak loads exhaust available bot licenses, causing delayed backlog processing.
122. **Increased Latency from Chaining**
Deeply nested workflows incur cumulative delays that violate end-to-end performance targets.
123. **Hidden Cost of Callbacks**
Use of webhook callbacks multiplies resource usage unexpectedly when misconfigured.
124. **Inadequate Sandbox Environments**
Test beds lacking realistic scale or data lead to undetected issues when automations go live.
125. **Excessive Custom Scripting**
Heavy reliance on bespoke code fragments undermines portability and increases technical debt.
