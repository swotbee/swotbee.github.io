# Operations/RevOps Automation: Items 151–175

## Problems (Items 151–175)

151. **Lack of Business Continuity Orchestration**
Automations lack coordinated failover across critical systems, leading to unplanned downtime when primary workflows fail.
152. **Undefined Retry Semantics**
Workflows retry on any error without differentiation, causing infinite loops or masked failures.
153. **Missing Dependency Version Control**
Upstream library updates break downstream automations when version pinning is absent.
154. **Untracked Bot Usage Metrics**
No usage metrics per workflow, preventing identification of high-value automations and hindering capacity planning.
155. **Disparate Monitoring Toolsets**
Multiple APM and logging solutions without unification obscure end-to-end observability.
156. **Invisible Exception Escalation Chains**
Errors aren’t escalated through proper channels, so critical incidents slip through without timely alerts.
157. **Hard-Coded Scheduling Cadence**
Crontab-style triggers embed timing logic in code, making schedule updates laborious and error-prone.
158. **Zombie Workflows**
Orphaned tasks linger in queues after cancellation requests, consuming resources indefinitely.
159. **Inconsistent SLA Configuration**
Different teams configure SLA thresholds variably, causing uneven enforcement and conflicting escalations.
160. **Unsupported Parallel Instance Control**
Concurrent job executions lack tunable parallelism limits, leading to resource contention.
161. **Unclear Data Ownership Lines**
No formal data stewardship model, so data governance and metadata management are ad hoc.
162. **Excessive Custom Alert Rules**
Hundreds of bespoke alerts flood channels with false positives, desensitizing responders.
163. **Neglected Endpoint Decommissioning**
Obsolete integrations remain active, producing intermittent failures as target services retire.
164. **Unmanaged Rate-Limit Backoffs**
Rigid backoff strategies either retry too aggressively or too slowly, causing downstream bottlenecks.
165. **Lack of Feature Flag Rollback**
Experiments injected via flags cannot be reverted automatically, prolonging outages when a new feature misbehaves.
166. **Opaque Bot Lifecycle Policies**
No standardized retirement or archival procedures for obsolete bots, cluttering orchestration dashboards.
167. **Point-to-Point Integration Sprawl**
Proliferation of ad hoc connectors creates maintenance overhead and brittle linkages.
168. **Unclear Functional Ownership**
No RACI model for automations, so responsibility for failures and enhancements is unclear.
169. **Missing Pre-Deployment Validation**
Lack of staging health checks leads to frequent production–only discovery of breaking changes.
170. **Improper Secret Rotation**
Static credentials embedded in workflows risk long-lived exposure and elevate security risk.
171. **Non-Transparent Cost Attribution**
Automation compute and license fees not allocated to business units, obscuring ROI debate.
172. **Sparse Regression Testing**
Only smoke tests run post-update, allowing edge-case failures to slip unnoticed into production.
173. **Absence of Automation Taxonomy**
No classification scheme for workflows, hindering prioritization and portfolio optimization.
174. **Uninstrumented Side-Effects**
Automated tasks invoke external APIs without logging responses, complicating auditing and debugging.
175. **Manual Approval Dependencies**
Essential human gates interspersed unpredictably within automated flows, nullifying end-to-end efficiency.
