# Operations/RevOps Automation: Items 126–150

## Problems (Items 126–150)

126. **Process Documentation Gaps**
Automations lack formal documentation of business rules, making handovers and audits error-prone.
127. **Skill Obsolescence**
Rapid tool evolution leaves in-house expertise outdated, slowing enhancements.
128. **Invisible Shadow IT Automations**
Undocumented macros and scripts proliferate uncontrolled, bypassing governance.
129. **API Version Mismatches**
Upstream service updates break automated integrations when version dependencies aren’t tracked.
130. **Excessive Bot Latency**
Sequential bot steps introduce cumulative delays, violating real-time processing needs.
131. **Ineffective Process Discoverability**
Lack of centralized process inventories hinders identification of automation candidates.
132. **Inadequate User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
Skipping end-user validation leads to automations that don’t align with real-world workflows.
133. **Rigid Scheduling Models**
Fixed-time triggers can’t adapt to event-driven or on-demand automation needs.
134. **Platform Monocultures**
Dependence on a single vendor’s tooling inhibits experimentation and resilience.
135. **Poor Exception Prioritization**
All errors generate equal alerts, overwhelming teams with low-impact notifications.
136. **Lack of Data Versioning**
Automations process evolving datasets without tracking record changes, compounding errors.
137. **Complex Credential Management**
Multiple service accounts with divergent lifecycles create security and maintenance headaches.
138. **Unvetted Third-Party Plugins**
External extensions introduce vulnerabilities and break with core platform updates.
139. **Insufficient Load Testing**
Unvalidated concurrency leads to unanticipated resource contention under peak loads.
140. **Disconnected Change Control**
Deployments bypass change boards, resulting in undocumented production changes.
141. **Non-Standard Naming Conventions**
Inconsistent object names and folder structures impede automation discovery and governance.
142. **Fragmented Feedback Loops**
Operational teams lack mechanisms to report automation failures for continuous improvement.
143. **Overlooked Business Continuity**
Critical automations lack fallback procedures for extended outages.
144. **Hard-to-Maintain Custom Code**
Bespoke scripts require specialist skills, creating single points of failure.
145. **Inefficient Bot Utilization**
Static bot pools remain idle or overloaded due to lack of dynamic allocation.
146. **Opaque Cost Tracking**
Automation expenses aren’t tagged by project, obscuring ROI analysis.
147. **Insufficient Alert Context**
Failure notifications omit metadata (e.g. transaction IDs), delaying root-cause analysis.
148. **Lack of Process SLA Definitions**
Without agreed SLAs, automations operate without clear performance targets.
149. **Poor Data Lineage**
Downstream analytics can’t trace issues back through automated transformations.
150. **Excessive Dependency Depth**
Deep call chains amplify failure points and complicate troubleshooting.
