    - Performance tracked in separate systems.
    - Insights are applied late or inconsistently.
- Siloed team testing prevents journey optimization:
    - Email, web, and SMS owned by different teams.
    - Results not shared for unified decision making.
    - No cross-channel promotion of winning variants.

**Before:**

1. Prioritize assets or journeys to test.
2. Draft variant copy or designs across intended touchpoints.
3. Launch microscale A/B splits on primary channel.

**After:**

1. Improvements often confined to tested channel.

    - Use statistical models to optimize journey impact.
- Automate staged/progressive rollout of winners:
    - Start with smaller audience cohorts.
    - Scale deployment as statistical confidence is reached.
    - Systematically pause underperformers and archive their data.


## Item: Failure to Align Campaign and Transactional Messaging

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “About Transactional messaging” (Adobe Campaign)

**Most common position:**
Message orchestration phase, after campaign and transactional flow mapping.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Use disparate tools for marketing and transactional communications:
    - ESP handles marketing; another system manages receipts, alerts, or confirmations.
    - Branding and compliance logic handled independently in each tool.
    - No automation tying service events to promotional journeys.
- Inconsistent policies and delivery timing:
    - Transactional messages are sent instantly; campaigns by schedule.
    - Little or no journey logic linking the two streams.
    - Users receive disjointed or redundant messaging.
- Siloed creative and data governance:
    - Campaign and transactional content created by different teams.
    - Assets, footers, and compliance elements differ.
    - Version or policy updates not rolled out universally.

**Before:**

1. Document messaging triggers and requirements for each stream.
2. Assign templates, creatives, and logic to respective teams.
3. Map journey handoffs or opportunities between message types.

**After:**

1. Disjointed customer experience hampers engagement.
2. Upsell, lifecycle, and support follow-ups are mistimed or missed.
3. Compliance and suppression logic gaps emerge.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Integrate unified orchestration engines for all send types:
    - Use journey builders that manage triggers across message classes.
    - Centralize creative, template, and suppression logic.
    - Report engagement from both marketing and transactional touchpoints together.
- Leverage transactional data to enrich campaigns:
    - Auto-enroll new buyers into onboarding or loyalty flows.
    - Suppress or delay promos based on order, support, or service triggers.
    - Reuse transactional assets in engagement journeys.
- Maintain shared creative and compliance libraries:
    - Standardize templates, footers, and content across systems.
    - Synchronize branding, compliance, and unsubscribe processes.
    - Continuously review performance and iterate for both message streams.


## Item: No Dynamic Channel Preference Management

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “5 Tips for Implementing Cross-Channel Marketing Automation” (MoEngage)

**Most common position:**
Channel orchestration phase, after segmentation, before launch.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Assigning static channel hierarchy (e.g., always email first):
    - Map customer contacts by rule, not preference.
    - No dynamic update based on recent engagement behavior.
    - Changes to preferences require manual support.
- Ignoring opt-ins/outs and multi-channel engagement behavior:
    - Send to all channels by default.
    - Cannot dynamically suppress or switch channels by signal.
    - No learning from user migration between channels.
- Manual preference control disconnected from automation:
    - Use forms for user-driven update only, no API sync.
    - Segments drift as users’ device/app usage evolves.
    - No periodic prompting to re-confirm preferences.

**Before:**

1. Segment and tag audience by initial contact method.
2. Implement or map initial channel using business rules.
3. Offer one-off or static preference collection points.

**After:**

1. High opt-outs and complaints from channel mismatch.
2. Drop in campaign engagement across legacy touchpoints.
3. Slow and error-prone manual workflows to realign channel selection.

    - Rarely reuse or modularize for consistency.
- Ignore best practices from earlier failures:
    - Patch solutions ad-hoc after breakdowns.
    - Lose oversight on recurring error types.
    - Manual logs forgotten or scattered across teams.

**Before:**

1. Map primary business workflow and intended outputs.
2. Set up connectors and assign action triggers.
3. Identify SLA or compliance points for success (but not for failure).

**After:**

1. Encounter unlogged workflow breaks and stuck processes.
2. Resort to reactive, urgent manual intervention.
3. Accumulate data or compliance risks due to silent failures.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Apply standardized error-handling subflows for all critical points.
    - Route failures to reusable error logic blocks.
    - Parse and log all exception details to a central system.

- Modularize remediation and notification routines.
    - Separate business logic from error clean-up across automations.
    - Automate ticketing and response hand-off when retries fail.
    - Create library of high-frequency fail scenarios for audit.
- Monitor and report workflow health continuously.
    - Use dashboards or SIEM integrations for error alerting.
    - Automate post-mortem reports for frequent or severe incidents.
    - Regularly review and refine coverage for new error types.

    - Design flows with only the “happy path,” omitting error/catch/fallback branches.
    - Scattered, in-line remediation steps instead of centralized, reusable logic.
    - Lack of instrumentation or alerting for detection of workflow halts.
- **Before:**

1. Sequence workflow steps for typical successful runs.
2. Integrate or trigger external systems without dedicated error policies.
3. Rely on manual checks or downstream complaints to reveal errors.
- **After:**

1. Workflow breakdowns occur quietly, causing stuck business processes or data loss.
2. Teams must respond reactively, increasing time-to-resolution.
3. Reliability and compliance suffer due to hidden or poorly managed error paths.
- **Ways to handle or act after this task:**
    - Modularize error-handling subflows for reuse and consistency.
    - Install monitoring and alerting to signal failures when they occur.
    - Regularly review logs and testing coverage, updating subflows as new issues arise.

**Most Common Position:**
Testing and optimization phase, after implementing email-based A/B testing, before journey-wide automation and omnichannel experimentation.

- **Ways to reach this task:**
    - Restricting A/B tests to ESP/email, not expanding to web, SMS, or app.
    - Manual management of test asset variants outside automation platforms.
    - Channel teams silo insights, missing journey-level collaborative optimization.
- **Before:**

1. Launch split tests for a single asset or channel (usually email).
2. Collect isolated performance data; act on results at the channel level.
3. Roll out successful variants manually (if at all) to other touchpoints.
- **After:**

1. Improvements remain isolated, not leveraged journey- or organization-wide.
2. Manual variant rollouts slow down learning cycles and optimization.
3. No unified cross-channel testing or reporting for campaign effectiveness.
- **Ways to handle or act after this task:**
    - Use full-journey experimentation platforms with multivariate testing across all assets and channels.
    - Automate winner rollouts and analytics; centralize learnings for quick application to all touchpoints.
    - Schedule regular, comprehensive test cycles covering every stage and channel.


## Failure to Align Campaign and Transactional Messaging
