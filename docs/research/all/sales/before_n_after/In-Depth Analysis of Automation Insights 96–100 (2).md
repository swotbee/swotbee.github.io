## Item: Poor Error-Handling Branching

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “8 Common Workflow Automation Mistakes to Avoid” (Flowwright)

**Most common position:**
Workflow configuration phase, after setting up main logic and integrations, before deployment to production.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Building sequential logic without exception routes:
    - Rely on a single execution path with no alternate for errors.
    - Omit explicit catch, fallback, or notification steps for failures.
    - No prior assessment of what could go wrong during integration.
- Embedding error management within main workflow:
    - Mix remediation and main process code in one place.
    - No modular, reusable approach to error handling.
    - Manual error notifications, not automated escalation or tracking.
- Ignoring persistent workflow monitoring or escalation policies:
    - No automated logs, dashboards, or error alerts applied.
    - Problems are usually discovered via downstream impacts.

**Before:**

1. Map main process logic, success paths, and required integrations.
2. Assign workflow actions/steps for each business outcome.
3. Define triggers for normal operation, but not for error/special cases.

**After:**

1. Error propagation leads to frozen processes or missed SLA events.
2. Teams must intervene manually for troubleshooting and remediation.
3. Data quality/compliance issues arise due to untrapped failure.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Modularize and standardize error-handling routines:
    - Use explicit subflows for error remediation, rollback, and cleanup.
    - Establish a centralized notification and escalation workflow.
    - Ensure every branch logs error events for audit/compliance.
- Instrument and monitor workflows with real-time alerts:
    - Configure dashboards and notifications for critical process failure.
    - Poll workflow health and error states at regular intervals.
    - Report issues to both technical and business owners automatically.
- Automate escalation and continuous improvement:
    - Route unresolved or repeated workflow errors to higher-level support.
    - Review incident logs in quarterly improvement cycles.
    - Refine error patterns and update subflows based on new risks.


## Item: Limited A/B Test Automation Beyond Email

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “6 Best Marketing Automation A/B Testing Tools in 2025” (Saffron Edge)

**Most common position:**
Full-funnel optimization phase, after initial channel-based splits (typically email), before omnichannel and journey automation.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Restricting experimentation to email only:
    - Run A/B tests on subject lines or content in ESPs.
    - Neglect landing pages, signup forms, web assets, and SMS.
    - No automated promotion of winners across assets and channels.
- Manual asset management for non-email tests:
    - Create and deploy web or form variants outside workflow automation.
    - Segment traffic by manual rules.
    - Gather and aggregate reporting via spreadsheet or ad hoc dashboards.
- Testing managed by isolated channel teams:
    - Web, email, push, and app tests are not coordinated.
    - Insights are not promoted consistently through the journey.
    - Feedback cycles between teams are slow and manual.

**Before:**

1. Formulate hypotheses and KPIs for individual experiments.
2. Deploy variants and setup splits in the chosen channel.
3. Record initial metrics for performance tracking.

**After:**

1. Channel wins do not scale journey- or campaign-wide.
2. Delayed or inconsistent promotion of successful assets.
3. Journey-centric optimization is missed; reports lack omnichannel clarity.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Use full multivariate and journey experimentation platforms:
    - Visual drag-and-drop experiment builders for any digital asset.
    - Roll out winning variants instantly across all touchpoints.
    - Automate test logs, variant history, and performance for compliance.
- Automate staged variant rollout/scheduling:
    - Start tests on controlled subgroups for low-risk validation.
    - Expand to rest of audience as results are proven.
    - Pause or remove underperforming assets automatically.
- Run coordinated journey-wide, cross-channel testing:
    - Consolidate reporting across every step and channel in one dashboard.
    - Coordinate variant deployment and winner promotion with automation rules.
    - Use shared experiment libraries and analytics for organization-wide learning.


## Item: Failure to Align Campaign and Transactional Messaging

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “About Transactional messaging” (Adobe Campaign)

**Most common position:**
Omnichannel orchestration phase, after mapping of all campaign and transactional journey triggers.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Siloed message creation and delivery systems:
    - Use distinct platforms and designed assets for campaigns and transactions.
    - Opt-outs, suppression, and compliance lists not shared.
    - Template updates and branding not propagated between message types.
- Asynchronous event schedules for each stream:
    - Campaigns run on calendar logic; transactionals trigger ad hoc on events.
    - Missed opportunities to suppress or synchronize messaging cadence.
    - No linking between transactional events and campaign journey entry points.
- Fragmented asset and compliance oversight:
    - Brand/compliance managed inconsistently between silos.
    - No unified approval process, content governance, or audit trail.
    - Separate reporting, missing journey continuity.

**Before:**

1. Catalog triggers, templates, and assignment of responsibility for each message class.
2. Map journeys and audience for both promotional and operational/transaction streams.
3. Assign business logic and compliance policies, often per team/platform.

**After:**

1. Customer experience becomes inconsistent across touchpoints.
2. Upsell and lifecycle moments are not optimized using transactional data.
3. Audit, analytics, and compliance gaps expose risk.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Centralize journey orchestration for all message types:
    - Use unified automation suite to map campaigns and transactionals in one logic flow.
    - Share assets, triggers, and opt-out logic universally.
    - Centralize reporting for 360° message and journey analytics.
- Use transactional events to trigger nurture and loyalty journeys:
    - Automate after-purchase or after-service campaigns.
    - Delay or suppress promos as needed post-transaction.
    - Segment and time further touches based on event recency and type.
- Implement modular creative and compliance controls:
    - Share template repositories, legal, and brand controls for all teams.
    - Apply real-time governance and update assets across all communications.
    - Maintain approval workflows and suppression updates in one system.


## Item: No Dynamic Channel Preference Management

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “5 Tips for Implementing Cross-Channel Marketing Automation” (MoEngage)

**Most common position:**
Orchestration and targeting phase, following segmentation and before campaign launch.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Assign default or fixed channels at sign-up:
    - Email or SMS preference selected once and then ignored.
    - No regular prompts or logic for preference update.
    - Opt-outs and channel drift go untracked across touchpoints.
- Infrequent, manual updates to preference centers:
    - Updates require support tickets or are driven only by user action.
    - No real-time or behavior-driven automation for channel shifts.
    - No logic for journey or segment migration by engagement.
- Ignore analytics and device/app signals for routing:
    - Continue messaging inactive or disengaged contacts without reassignment.
    - Churn, uninstalls, and opt-outs are handled after-the-fact.

**Before:**

1. Map channel assignment during onboarding or database import.
2. Carry set channel mapping through to journey branches and sends.
3. Collect explicit preferences only in initial forms.

**After:**

1. Engagement measures, opt-out, and churn indicate channel misfit.
2. Teams respond reactively via manual fixes.
3. Campaign ROI is reduced as preferred channels are overlooked.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Automate collection and use of channel preference at each touch:
    - Provide full preference center and dynamic update prompts in every journey.
    - Instantly propagate updates to all martech platforms.
    - Use workflow logic to branch by current user-preferred channel.
- Use analytics and AI to predict and apply channel shifts:
    - Monitor channel-level engagement live.
    - Migrate users to higher-performing channels as patterns change.
    - Segment contacts for ongoing channel fit optimization.
- Schedule regular reviews and compliance prompts:
    - Prompt users for refresh after inactivity, device switch, or major journey changes.
    - Sync all updates and log rationale/history platform-wide.
    - Audit for old or underutilized channels for ongoing governance.


## Item: Difficulty Integrating Offline Event Data

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “How to Integrate Offline and Online Data” (ReBid)

**Most common position:**
Integration and journey consolidation phase, after gathering event/field data but before journey orchestration.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Manually upload event/contact/call data to CRM or CDP:
    - Collect via spreadsheets from field ops, retail, or call centers.
    - Import into the system with basic ID mapping.
    - Frequently miss same-user matching or journey update in real time.
- Siloed storage and non-linked event records:
    - Store registrants or offline transactions in disconnected systems.
    - Manual deduplication and audit required for reporting.
    - Miss key event data in nurture/journey triggers.
- No deployment of conversion/event APIs for direct ingestion:
    - Delay or batch updates post-event, not supporting real-time touchpoint updates.
    - Attribute journeys or conversion only to digital triggers.
    - Field, sales, and campaign units operate and report independently.

**Before:**

1. Collect all offline data in structured, import-ready format.
2. Assign mapping and deduplication rules for digital profile linkage.
3. Set process for manual enrichment and journey alignment.

**After:**

1. Attribution, segment, and ROI reports are fragmented.
2. Manual reconciliation and campaign update cycles lead to inefficiency.
3. Key nurture or journey triggers are missed.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Deploy automated event data ingestion pipelines (APIs/webhooks):
    - Use Meta/Google Conversions API for near-real-time event mapping.
    - Link event attendance and outcomes directly to journey profiles.
    - Automate follow-up campaigns or scores as event data arrives.
- Enrich and unify digital records via CDP or CRM integration:
    - Map, append, and deduplicate with advanced matching for unified view.
    - Launch segmentation and journey triggers from any event.
    - Ensure compliance and reporting standardization across all data sources.
- Automate journey logic using event/object frameworks:
    - Treat both online and offline signals as triggers.
    - Coordinate full-funnel segmentation and nurture logic for cross-channel ROI.
    - Configure compliance, enrichment, suppression, and personalization rules universally.
