## Item: Poor Error-Handling Branching

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “8 Common Workflow Automation Mistakes to Avoid” (Flowwright)

**Most common position:**
Flow design and configuration phase, after outlining logic and integrations but before deployment.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Design linear automation with no branches for error or exception handling.
    - Only map out expected happy paths.
    - Omit else/catch blocks for unexpected conditions.
    - Skip test cases for integration failure or data issues.
- Build complex, conditional flows but without modular error checks.
    - Stack nested logic blocks directly in the main workflow.
    - Add multiple actions per step, making troubleshooting difficult.
    - Fail to delegate exception paths to reusable subflows.
- Ignore retry/back-off for external system failure.
    - Integrate API steps with no timeout logic.
    - Allow processes to halt on first error, manual reset needed.
    - Forget escalation or alert steps for persistent issues.

**Before:**

1. List process steps and intended success cases.
2. Map all integrations and logic rules for the workflow.
3. Validate main business flow in QA/test.

**After:**

1. Experiences silent or hard-to-trace failures.
2. Teams intervene to restart or reroute failed automations manually.
3. End users may lose data or experience service disruptions.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Build Try/Catch or error scope containers around risky steps.
    - Explicitly route failures to alternate logic or notification flows.
    - Log errors in a dedicated, searchable repository.
    - Complete essential cleanup even when a task fails.
- Develop and reuse modular error-handling subflows.
    - Centralize error notifications and escalation procedures.
    - Use shared routines for common problems (e.g., integration timeout, bad data).
    - Document error patterns for ongoing reporting and tuning.
- Automate recovery and escalation actions.
    - Retain control with retry/back-off rules for transient errors.
    - Escalate persistent failures to human queue or incident tracker.
    - Send detailed support tickets or links to error logs for quick resolution.


## Item: Limited A/B Test Automation Beyond Email

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “6 Best Marketing Automation A/B Testing Tools in 2025” (Saffron Edge)

**Most common position:**
Optimization/testing phase, after basic email A/B splits and before journey-wide or multichannel experiments.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Restrict tests to email subject lines or body content.
    - Use ESP splits for open/click optimization only.
    - Miss landing page, SMS, push, or display asset tests.
    - Only review isolated channel analytics.
- Manually build test variants for web assets.
    - Duplicate forms or pages and route users ad hoc.

    - Promote winning variants to other campaigns by hand.
- Teams operate channel-specific, uncoordinated tests.
    - No journey- or full-funnel test design.
    - Variants not tracked for consistent user experience.
    - Insights not rolled up or distributed to all stakeholders.

**Before:**

1. Select campaign or channel for initial test (usually email).
2. Draft separate variants for targeted asset or audience.
3. Establish success metrics for primary channel tested.

**After:**

1. Incremental improvements limited to channel tested.
2. Update winners manually in broader campaigns or journeys.
3. Don't realize cross-channel or journey-wide optimization potential.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Implement multivariate testing for web, landing pages, and forms.
    - Use visual editors for test creation and user routing.
    - Automate variant rollout based on statistical significance.
    - Centralize metrics in a unified dashboard for all assets.
- Expand tests to full journeys and cross-channel flows.
    - Orchestrate experiments that span email, SMS, push, and web.
    - Trigger next-step automations based on AB/MV test results.
    - Share findings and best practices with all channel teams.
- Automate progressive test scheduling and winner promotion.
    - Deploy promising variants to small cohorts first.
    - Auto-scale successful versions.
    - Pause or retire underperforming treatments by rule.


## Item: Failure to Align Campaign and Transactional Messaging

**Type:** Problem
**Workflow reference:** “About Transactional messaging” (Adobe Campaign)

**Most common position:**
Message orchestration phase, immediately after mapping of marketing journey and transaction event logic.

**Ways to reach this task:**

- Use separate ESPs or tools for promo and transactional emails.
    - Create disconnected content templates and delivery policies.
    - Maintain independent lists/suppression logic per tool.
    - Miss targeting transactional events as triggers for nurture.
- Schedule campaigns but let transactional sends fire ad hoc.
    - No suppression, timing, or sequence logic shared.
    - Can't cross-reference events for follow-up cadence.
    - Transactional triggers never enroll users in post-purchase flows.
- Different departments manage message classes.
    - Marketing for promo, product or operations for transactionals.
    - No unified approval, creative, or compliance checklist.
    - Gaps in branding, engagement, opt-out, and reporting policies.

**Before:**

1. Define business requirements for both campaign and transactional messages.
2. Create journey maps and specify desired triggers/conversions.
3. Assign channels and tools for each stream.

**After:**

1. Customer receives disconnected experience, with inconsistent branding/suppression logic.
2. Missed opportunities for post-transaction nurture and upsell.
3. Incomplete analytics and reporting by journey or contact.

**Ways to handle or act after this task:**

- Integrate all message types in a unified orchestration tool or journey builder.
    - Route campaign and transaction messages through a single workflow.
    - Use event triggers from transactions to fire nurture or satisfaction automations.
    - Standardize creative, compliance, and reporting assets.
