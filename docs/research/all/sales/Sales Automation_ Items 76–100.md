# Sales Automation: Items 76–100

Below are the next 25 distinct **Sales Automation** items—problems, successful implementations, and tips \& tricks—ranked by prevalence, impact, and endorsement. These do not duplicate items 1–75.

## Problems (76–100)

76. **Unstructured Data Ingestion Issues**
Automation tools struggle to parse and normalize free-form fields (e.g., notes, chats), leading to missed insights.

- “Our chatbot transcripts aren’t searchable in CRM.”
- “Manual cleanup needed for custom form responses.”
- “We can’t auto-tag leads from free-text fields.”
- “Sentiment analysis fails on raw meeting notes.”
- “Legacy notes still need manual entry.”

77. **Offline-to-Online Event Gaps**
Automations ignore in-person interactions (calls, events), fragmenting the customer journey.

- “Tradeshow leads never sync back to workflows.”
- “In-person demo attendance isn’t triggering follow-ups.”
- “No webhook for scanned badges.”
- “Offline call logs miss sequence triggers.”
- “Event QR scans aren’t feeding CRM.”

78. **Low Video Outreach Adoption**
Teams underutilize automated personalized video messages despite proven engagement lift.

- “Reps hesitate to record videos at scale.”
- “No template for quick video sends.”
- “Video links break in email clients.”
- “Lack of coaching on video best practices.”
- “Analytics don’t track video play rates.”

79. **Robotic Voice Assistant Misfires**
IVR and automated call agents misroute or drop calls, harming customer experience.

- “Our voice bot sends prospects to wrong rep.”
- “Dropped calls not logged for follow-up.”
- “No fallback when AI mishears digits.”
- “Missed handoffs from bot to live agent.”
- “Bot scripts can’t handle accents.”

80. **Inability to Track Account-Based Metrics**
Automation workflows lack account-level orchestration, focusing only on individual contacts.

- “Multi-contact playbooks aren’t supported.”
- “No roll-up of sequence engagement by company.”
- “ABM alerts fire per email, not per account.”
- “Account health scores missing workflow triggers.”
- “Cross-functional cadence coordination fails.”

81. **Data Sovereignty \& Localization Constraints**
Regional data storage laws block certain automations or slow integrations.

- “EU leads housed in separate instance with no workflows.”
- “APAC data residency prevents cloud function calls.”
- “Latency issues from geo-redundant APIs.”
- “Consent records fragmented by region.”
- “Tool lacks regional hosting option.”

82. **Incomplete Revenue Operations Alignment**
Siloed automations in sales and marketing prevent unified funnel optimization.

- “Rev-ops can’t see workflow logic in sales tool.”
- “Marketing triggers ignored in sales sequences.”
- “No shared view of MQL→SQL handoff timings.”
- “Forecast models exclude automation data.”
- “Alerts overlap between departments.”

83. **Misconfigured Security Protocols**
Automation APIs run with excessive privileges, exposing data risks.

- “Zapier connections use admin keys.”
- “OAuth tokens never rotate.”
- “Webhooks unverified by IP.”
- “No certificate pinning for critical flows.”
- “Default API scopes too broad.”

84. **Slow API Performance Under Load**
High-volume workflows stall when third-party APIs throttle or lag.

- “Batch enrichment takes hours, not minutes.”
- “Webhook queues overflow during peak.”
- “Real-time scoring calls time out.”
- “Callouts fail silently under spike.”
- “No circuit breaker on repeated failures.”

85. **Personalization at Scale Limits**
Systems choked by too many dynamic content rules, causing timeouts or broken emails.

- “Over 50 conditional blocks slows template rendering.”
- “Missing fallback values create blank sections.”
- “Dynamic image embeds fail to load.”
- “Excessive tokens trigger rate limits.”
- “Merge tag errors not flagged pre-send.”

86. **Poor Mobile Push Integration**
Inconsistent mobile notification workflows lead to duplicated or missed alerts.

- “Push campaigns fire alongside email, annoying users.”
- “Mobile tokens differ from email fields.”
- “Locale-based notifications not supported.”
- “No automated opt-in prompts.”
- “Delivery reports not synced back.”

87. **Unmonitored Conversational AI Drift**
Chatbots and voice AIs degrade over time without retraining, misclassifying intents.

- “Bot asks wrong qualification questions.”
- “Intent taxonomy changes break flows.”
- “No automated retrain schedule.”
- “Legacy utterances still accepted.”
- “No feedback loop from live agents.”

88. **Lack of Offline Fallback Paths**
Workflows with real-time calls to external services lack queuing, so failures drop leads.

- “Failed Twilio calls never retried.”
- “Document generation errors skip step, no alert.”
- “Leads get stuck when enrichment API fails.”
- “No dead-letter queue for failed webhooks.”
- “Sequence halts without error flag.”

89. **Inconsistent Timezone Handling**
Cross-region automations misfire due to server-side timestamp miscalculations.

- “Email sends land at midnight local time.”
- “Date triggers ignore daylight savings.”
- “Follow-ups skip weekends unexpectedly.”
- “Calendar invites double-book.”
- “Relative date delays misalign.”

90. **Underutilized Behavioral Triggers**
Teams rely on basic form-fill or page-view events, missing higher-value behavioral signals.

- “No trigger on demo video completion.”
- “Chat engagement not feeding sequences.”
- “Feature usage events ignored.”
- “Download interactions don’t update scoring.”
- “In-app events never route to sales.”

91. **Fragmented Consent Logging**
Opt-in/opt-out events not centrally recorded, risking non-compliance.

- “Email unsubscribes stored separately from SMS.”
- “Cookie banner consents not in CRM.”
- “No audit trail of consent changes.”
- “Legacy lists bypass sync.”
- “Multiple preference centers conflicting.”

92. **Neglecting Workflow Documentation**
Rapid automation builds proceed without mapping, causing maintenance nightmares.

- “No visual flow diagram for sequences.”
- “Change history not logged.”
- “Admins don’t know which flow sends which email.”
- “Documentation stale after updates.”
- “Onboarding new admins takes weeks.”

93. **Poor A11y (Accessibility) in Automated Content**
Templates and automated messages don’t meet accessibility standards, excluding some recipients.

- “Emails lack alt-text on images.”
- “Templates use small font sizes.”
- “Push notifications unreadable by screen readers.”
- “Missing high-contrast options.”
- “No ARIA labels in chatbot UI.”

94. **Ignoring Dark Data Sources**
Automations omit rich datasets from support tickets, billing systems, or ERP.

- “Support tickets never trigger upsell sequences.”
- “Billing churn signals not routed.”
- “ERP order events ignored.”
- “On-premise logs not integrated.”
- “Help-desk tags absent in CRM.”

95. **No Predictive Churn Workflows**
Automated sequences fail to address at-risk accounts identified by churn models.

- “Churn alerts sit in BI, not in workflows.”
- “No churn-prevention email cadences.”
- “Usage anomalies not triggering outreach.”
- “Health score drops not routed.”
- “No automated win-back campaigns.”

96. **Overlooking Meta-Automation (Automation of Automation)**
Teams don’t automate routine workflow health checks or version snapshots.

- “No scheduled flow integrity tests.”
- “Version backups manual only.”
- “No synthetic record tests post-deployment.”
- “Health dashboards require manual refresh.”
- “Change alerts not system-driven.”

97. **Excessive Conditional Complexity**
Workflows with nested if/then structures become unmanageable and error-prone.

- “Twelve nested splits in a single flow.”
- “Admins avoid updates for fear of breakage.”
- “Logic spaghetti slows debugging.”
- “Sequence branches multiply exponentially.”
- “Maintenance window widens.”

98. **Untracked Legacy Integrations**
Old custom connectors persist undocumented, causing silent failures during upgrades.

- “API scripts written years ago still active.”
- “No repo for legacy code.”
- “Connector maintenance unknown.”
- “Upgrades break hidden endpoints.”
- “Failure alerts not in place.”

99. **Lack of Personalization Governance**
Uncoordinated token use leads to inconsistent brand voice and legal risks (e.g., unapproved phrasing).

- “Different teams use different merge tags for same field.”
- “Legal disclaimers omitted in some sequences.”
- “Unofficial templates circulate uncontrolled.”
- “Tone of messages varies wildly.”
- “No approval workflow for new content blocks.”

100. **Failure to Sunset Unused Channels**
Inactive SMS, push, or social connectors remain enabled, cluttering workflows and costing licenses.

- “Old Twilio integrations still active in sandbox.”
- “Inactive push credentials still configured.”
- “Unused LinkedIn connectors count toward seat limits.”
- “Disconnected chat channels still polling APIs.”
- “Deprecated webhooks still firing.”
