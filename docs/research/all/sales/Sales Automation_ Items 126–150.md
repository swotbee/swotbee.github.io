# Sales Automation: Items 126–150

Below are the next 25 distinct **Sales Automation** items—problems, successful implementations, and tips \& tricks—ranked by prevalence, impact, and community endorsement. These do not duplicate items 1–125.

## Problems (126–150)

126. **Inflexible Pricing Logic**
Automated discount and pricing engines can’t accommodate complex, tiered pricing models, leading to manual overrides.

- “Bulk discounts require manual spreadsheet updates.”
- “Volume tiers aren’t reflected in proposals automatically.”
- “Region-based pricing rules broken in automation.”
- “Custom quotes slip through automated flows.”
- “Pricing token errors in contract templates.”

127. **Poor SSL/TLS Certificate Management**
Expired or misconfigured certificates on integration endpoints cause silent workflow failures.

- “API calls fail without clear error on expired cert.”
- “Webhook endpoints reject calls after auto-renewal misses.”
- “No alerts when certs are near expiration.”
- “Self-signed certs blocked by strict TLS settings.”
- “Manual renewals often delayed.”

128. **Insufficient GDPR Data Minimization**
Automations retain unnecessary personal data, violating data minimization principles and increasing risk.

- “Lead enrichments store unneeded sensitive attributes.”
- “Old form fields capture extra PII, never purged.”
- “Data retention jobs miss orphaned records.”
- “Stale GDPR consents hang in the system.”
- “Privacy audits identify excess data stores.”

129. **Uncoordinated Promo Code Distribution**
Coupon and promo-code workflows distribute invalid or duplicate codes, harming campaign integrity.

- “Expired codes still sent in nurture emails.”
- “Same code reused across segments.”
- “No automated deactivation of redeemed codes.”
- “Coupling codes to wrong offers.”
- “Integration delays send invalid codes.”

130. **Overlooked Accessibility in Scheduling Tools**
Calendar widgets and booking links aren’t screen-reader friendly or keyboard-navigable.

- “Assistive tech users can’t select time slots.”
- “Accessibility labels missing on calendar elements.”
- “Color contrasts in booking pages non-compliant.”
- “Focus traps prevent form navigation.”
- “No ALT text on calendar icons.”

131. **Limited Support for GraphQL APIs**
Workflows expecting REST patterns fail when vendors adopt GraphQL endpoints without backward compatibility.

- “GraphQL endpoints return different error schemas.”
- “Automation connectors lack GraphQL query builders.”
- “Fragment support missing in workflow designers.”
- “No subscription (real-time) support.”
- “GraphQL auth flows differ from REST.”

132. **Inefficient Session State Handling**
Automations that depend on session-based data lose context across multi-step engagements.

- “Chatbot session data resets between pages.”
- “Email thread context lost after link click.”
- “Web form hidden fields reset unexpectedly.”
- “API sessions expire too quickly.”
- “Session tokens not shared across subdomains.”

133. **Unmonitored Third-Party Queue Backlogs**
External queuing services (e.g., SQS, Pub/Sub) build up without visibility, delaying event-driven automations.

- “No dashboard for queue depth.”
- “Backpressure causes missed triggers.”
- “Delayed notifications during backlog spikes.”
- “Dead-letter queues fill unnoticed.”
- “Alert thresholds never configured.”

134. **Neglecting Zero-Party Data Collection**
Automations over-rely on third-party enrichments instead of soliciting user-provided preferences, reducing accuracy.

- “Preference centers never prompt new questions.”
- “Enrichment fields outdated quickly.”
- “No in-sequence surveys to update profiles.”
- “Users unaware of data-sharing options.”
- “Reps can’t adjust enrichment overrides manually.”

135. **Unscalable Custom Code Hooks**
Inline scripts and code actions in workflows become bottlenecks when platform limits execution time or resources.

- “Custom JS tasks time out after 30s.”
- “Platform upgrades break inline code.”
- “Debugging scripts in UI is painful.”
- “Execution logs truncated.”
- “Resource quotas hit during spikes.”

136. **Fragmented ABM Engagement Reporting**
Account-based metrics split across tools prevent unified view of sequence effectiveness at the account level.

- “Email tool shows per-contact opens, not per-account engagement.”
- “CRM dashboards lack aggregated account heatmaps.”
- “No roll-up of meeting attendance by company.”
- “Account scoring not updated by flow events.”
- “ABM tool triggers not synced with CRM reports.”

137. **Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Workflow Access**
Lack of enforced MFA for admin users increases risk of unauthorized changes to critical automations.

- “Single-sign-on sessions stay active too long.”
- “MFA exceptions used for service accounts.”
- “No policy for periodic password resets.”
- “Admin access logs incomplete.”
- “Phishing-resistant authentication not supported.”

138. **Poor Handling of Time-Sensitive Offers**
Automated campaigns send expired promotions or miss windows for limited-time discounts.

- “Offers sent out after campaign end date.”
- “Sequence logic doesn’t adjust for DST shifts.”
- “No dynamic date checks in flows.”
- “Regional blackout dates ignored.”
- “Time-zone triggers miscalculate end times.”

139. **Incomplete Renewal \& Upsell Lifecycle Coverage**
Workflows cover initial renewal reminder but neglect follow-up sequences for late renewals or upsell windows.

- “No second-chance reminder for missed renewals.”
- “Upsell offers not sequenced post-renewal.”
- “Lack of tailored outreach for loyalty tiers.”
- “Contract extension automations stop after first reminder.”
- “No cross-sell messaging for add-ons.”

140. **Under-Configured Rate Limits on Outbound Calls**
Voice call automations exceed carrier thresholds, resulting in dropped or blocked calls.

- “Call bursts trigger spam filters.”
- “No per-minute call cap in workflows.”
- “Dialer API responds with 429 errors unhandled.”
- “No automatic back-off on repeated failures.”
- “Carrier blacklists triggered.”

141. **Lack of API Circuit Breakers**
Automations continue calling degraded services without circuit breaker patterns, exacerbating outages.

- “Failed endpoints retried indefinitely.”
- “Chained calls cascade failures.”
- “No fail-fast logic.”
- “Service outages halt critical flows.”
- “No auto-disable on repeated errors.”

142. **Insufficient Support for Web Components**
Modern front-end widgets (custom elements) not recognized by form-fillers or tracking scripts, missing events.

- “Chatbot built in Web Components doesn’t fire native events.”
- “Form custom elements bypass auto-fill.”
- “Tracking pixels don’t catch widget interactions.”
- “Shadow DOM elements invisible to analytics.”
- “No polyfills in integration scripts.”

143. **Poor Data Anonymization Practices**
Automations that share data with external analytics or enrichment vendors expose identifiable information unnecessarily.

- “Pseudonymized IDs still traceable.”
- “PII fields not masked in test environments.”
- “Export jobs send raw email addresses.”
- “HIPAA-sensitive fields inadequately redacted.”
- “No field-level encryption in flight.”

144. **Underused Sequential SMS Workflows**
Teams treat SMS as one-off blasts instead of multi-step, conditional cadences, limiting engagement potential.

- “No follow-up SMS based on reply or click.”
- “Single reminder message only.”
- “No branching for do-not-disturb windows.”
- “SMS templates lack personalization tokens.”
- “Automations can’t switch to email fallback.”

145. **Inconsistent Use of Webhooks vs. Polling**
Some integrations still use polling where webhooks exist, causing delays and extra costs.

- “Polling intervals set to 5 minutes instead of real-time webhooks.”
- “Polling jobs rack up API usage fees.”
- “Duplicate events when both webhook and poll coexist.”
- “Data freshness impacted.”
- “No consolidation of event sources.”

146. **Unmonitored Email Deliverability Metrics**
Lack of automated insights on bounce rates, spam complaints, or sender reputation leads to degraded outreach performance.

- “No alert when bounce rate climbs above threshold.”
- “Spam-trap hits not reported in dashboards.”
- “No automated warm-up for new IPs.”
- “Sender score dips go unnoticed.”
- “Complaints not fed back into suppression lists.”

147. **Ineffective Document Generation Templates**
Automated document assembly uses rigid templates that break under slight format changes, requiring manual fixes.

- “Contract paragraphs shift unexpectedly.”
- “Merge-field overflows disrupt layout.”
- “No conditional clauses for optional terms.”
- “Page breaks fall in wrong places.”
- “Header/footer fields inconsistent.”

148. **Failure to Automate Compliance Reporting**
Manual extraction and compilation for audit reports wastes time and risks omissions.

- “Data privacy reports exported manually each quarter.”
- “No scheduled reports for consent logs.”
- “Audit trails compiled in spreadsheets.”
- “No automated governance dashboards.”
- “Report generation prone to human error.”

149. **Lack of Real-Time Behavioral Analytics**
Workflows separate from analytics platforms can’t adapt to live engagement signals.

- “No instant triggers on high-value page interactions.”
- “Dashboards updated hourly, not in minutes.”
- “Real-time chat engagements ignored.”
- “Event-driven insights not wired into cadences.”
- “Streaming data not integrated.”

150. **Underprioritized Feature Deprecation Management**
Automations continue to use soon-to-be-deprecated platform features, risking abrupt failures.

- “Legacy API versions sunset without migration.”
- “Deprecated connectors still in live flows.”
- “No roadmap tracking for feature EOL.”
- “Upgrade breaks flows unexpectedly.”
- “No automated code checks for deprecated calls.”
