## about company
Our consultancy empowers B2B and technology companies to maximize HubSpot ROI through end-to-end services. We implement and optimize Marketing, Sales, Service, CMS, and RevOps workflows; design custom dashboards and reports; automate lead capture, nurturing, and handoffs; integrate third-party systems; and deliver training and ongoing support to drive predictable revenue growth.


For the above, I am working on a website which should help our potential customers to understand our services and how we can help them. The website should be clear, concise, and focused on the benefits of our services. 

üß© **Objective:**  
Help me analyze a specific use case by reviewing the attached documents and identifying key challenges faced by CRM users. Based on these insights, I will create a structured list of challenges, solutions, and impacts that can be used to enhance our service offerings and marketing materials. The challenges, solutions, and impacts should really resonate with the users' experiences and language, making it relatable and actionable. I would like to focus on the way how they have described their challenges, solutions, and impacts in the forums, social media, and product reviews.

üîç **Instructions:**  
- Explore the documents to understand the use case.
- Search for relevant discussions by CRM users across social media, forums, and product reviews.
- From these insights, identify commonly reported challenges.
- Understand which of these challenges are most frequently mentioned and reference them in the output.

üìù **Expected Output:**  
- Provide a bulleted list of **Challenge ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Impact** items.
- Each bullet should include:
- A **short title** (max 10 words) along with the actual title provided in the source doc
- 3 **challenge** (10‚Äì15 words) along with a short title with max 5 words
- **solution** for each of challenge (10‚Äì15 words) along with a short title with max 5 words
- The **impact** for each of solution (10‚Äì15 words) along with a short title with max 5 words
- Order the list based on how frequently each challenge appears.
- Use simple, context-appropriate language that reflects how users themselves describe the issues.
