## about company
Our consultancy empowers B2B and technology companies to maximize HubSpot ROI through end-to-end services. We implement and optimize Marketing, Sales, Service, CMS, and RevOps workflows; design custom dashboards and reports; automate lead capture, nurturing, and handoffs; integrate third-party systems; and deliver training and ongoing support to drive predictable revenue growth.


For the above, I am working on a website which should help our potential customers to understand our services and how we can help them. The website should be clear, concise, and focused on the benefits of our services. 

üß© **Objective:**  
Help me analyze a specific use case by reviewing the attached documents and identifying key challenges faced by CRM users.

üîç **Instructions:**  
- Explore the documents to understand the use case.
- Search for relevant discussions by CRM users across social media, forums, and product reviews.
- From these insights, identify commonly reported challenges.

üìù **Expected Output:**  
- Provide a bulleted list of **Challenge ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Impact** items.
- Each bullet should include:
  - A **short title** (max 6 words)
  - A **challenge** (20‚Äì25 words)
  - Its **solution** (20‚Äì25 words)
  - The **impact** (20‚Äì25 words)
- Order the list based on how frequently each challenge appears.
- Use simple, context-appropriate language that reflects how users themselves describe the issues.
