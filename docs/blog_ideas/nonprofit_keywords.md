# I have a list of keywords sourced from a website keyword research tool. I’d like help identifying which of these keywords are specifically related to nonprofits—please exclude any that don’t apply. To do this can you check if each keyword is related to nonprofit, if not exclude it.

Once you’ve filtered out the non-relevant ones, please organize the remaining nonprofit-related keywords into meaningful categories or thematic groups based on common topics (e.g. fundraising, volunteering, nonprofit management, legal compliance, grants, etc.).
Finally, provide a fully categorized list of these nonprofit keywords.
