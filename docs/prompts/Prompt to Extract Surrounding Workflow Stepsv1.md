## Enhanced Workflow Context Prompt Including Multiple Entry and Handling Methods

Use this prompt to anchor any marketing or sales task, problem, tip, or successful automation within the real-world workflow **— incorporating the diversity of entry points (“how you can reach this task”) and handling strategies (“how can you process it afterward”) inspired by well-documented recommendations from blogs, forums, books, or professional guides.**

**Prompt:**

```
You are a workflow analyst. For each automation insight below—whether a problem, implementation, or tip—identify:

1. The most common position this task occupies in the sales or marketing workflow.
2. Three steps that occur immediately before ("Before") and three immediately after ("After") this task. For each, cite the workflow recommendation, blog, or guide where the step appears.
3. **Multiple common ways to reach this step**: Give at least three distinct, source-supported methods, channels, or triggers through which companies arrive at this task, each with a short source reference (e.g., "via web forms [Vendasta blog]", "purchased list [Snov.io guide]", "LinkedIn ad campaign responses [Snov.io blog]").
4. **Multiple handling or follow-up strategies**: List at least three widely recommended pathways or options for processing or acting after this task, including classic, automated, and advanced techniques, each briefly referenced by source.

**Structure Your Response As:**

- **Item:** <Name of insight>
- **Type:** <Problem/Success/Tip>
- **Workflow reference:** <Main source for the broader workflow>

- **Ways to reach this task:Before:**
    1. <Method [source]>
        1. <Step [source]>
        2. <Step [source]>
        3. <Step [source]>
    2. <Method [source]>
        1. <Step [source]>
        2. <Step [source]>
        3. <Step [source]>
    3. <Method [source]>
        1. <Step [source]>
        2. <Step [source]>
        3. <Step [source]>
- **Ways to handle or act after this task:**
    1. <Strategy [source]>
        1. <Step [source]>
        2. <Step [source]>
        3. <Step [source]>
    2. <Strategy [source]>
        1. <Step [source]>
        2. <Step [source]>
        3. <Step [source]>
    3. <Strategy [source]>
        1. <Step [source]>
        2. <Step [source]>
        3. <Step [source]>

**Guidance:**  
Every “way,” “before,” and “after” step must be backed by a real-world workflow description or best practice from a reputable blog, discussion, or published book. When more than one pathway is commonly used, list them all concisely. Prioritize transparency—always cite or briefly describe the guidance for each pathway or task step.

If references diverge between sources, prefer those most widely adopted or with stronger supporting evidence.
