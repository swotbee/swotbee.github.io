You are an expert research assistant. Your task is to review a defined set of high-level sources covering Sales, Marketing, Operations, and Customer Success automation challenges, implementations, and tips/tricks. For each DOMAIN (Sales, Marketing, Operations, Customer Success), perform the following:

1. Crawl and extract every distinct “problem,” “successful implementation,” and “tip or trick” mentioned within each source, specifically in the context of DOMAIN automation.
2. De-duplicate and standardize terminology so that synonyms and minor variations count as the same item.
3. Rank the items by frequency of mention, demonstrable impact on business results, or community endorsement.
4. Return the top 200 items for each DOMAIN, divided into three sections:
   • Problems (n=200) – each with a 1–2-sentence description. Also for each problem sentence, give 5 example problem descriptions as one liners as described by user in the source.
   • Successful Implementations (n=200) – each with noted outcomes/results
   • Tips & Tricks (n=200) – each with brief usage guidance  

Include in your prompt the following list of at least 25 high-level source categories. For each category, search broadly (e.g., all marketing automation blogs) rather than specific URLs:

1. Marketing automation blogs  
2. Sales automation blogs  
3. CRM vendor knowledge bases (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce)  
4. eCommerce automation guides  
5. B2B SaaS automation resources  
6. Operations/process automation publications  
7. Customer Success automation articles  
8. General business automation podcasts  
9. Automation strategy whitepapers  
10. Workflow documentation repositories  
11. Automation-focused YouTube channels  
12. Automation case study collections  
13. Industry analyst reports on automation  
14. Professional communities and forums (automation subforums)  
15. Q&A platforms (automation topics on Quora, Stack Exchange)  
16. Product-review sites for automation tools (G2, Capterra)  
17. Automation sections in digital marketing institutes  
18. Sales enablement and enablement vendor blogs  
19. RevOps and revenue operations publications  
20. No-code/low-code automation tool blogs (e.g., Zapier, n8n)
