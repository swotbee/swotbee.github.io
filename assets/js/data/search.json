We don’t just sit back and let our clients do all work while we reap the rewards—we strategize, define personas that these campaigns will target, create messaging which connects with those consumers on a personal level; then finally execute flawlessly, so there’s no room left for error!A PMM doesn’t end up being very useful without first understanding its purpose – helping you reach your goals more effectively than ever before through strategic planning to develop a hypothesis; AB tests the ideas to collect information and prove it was correct.Firstly how best to use what resources you’ve got available; secondly, deciding which tactics will work better than others - but before anything else- knowing whether they’re aligned with your goals (and values). The key to success in product marketing is identifying problems and attacking them across functions. This requires a deep understanding of all areas that impact our quarterly goals(OKRs), which we can’t hope to achieve unless our PMs hold responsibility for both top-level KPIs like conversions in MQL or SQL(or TOFU/MOFU/BOFU), the stickiness of the product once customers come in as well as their CSAT Score.ICP (Ideal customer profile) or Personas: The customer profile should be defined thoroughly, and the marketing team needs to understand them well. Research has been conducted on these populations, but we can point out which data relate specifically to our argument/proof of concept.A good way is by providing examples such as customer testimonials or research data from surveys completed among consumers who buy one particular product line over another so they may feel more familiar with their preferences compared to other brands available within an industry category. Personas are the lifeblood of any marketing or sales organization. They help us understand our customer’s needs, wants, and desires so that we can provide them with a solution that will leave their hearts racing in excitement! However good your company might be at understanding people at first glance, though- without proper research done beforehand, there won’t be much chance for success when trying to market products toward these demographics later down the line.Sales enablement is a critical part of any company’s success. PMMs play an integral role in making sure that the field on their competition, product positioning, and messaging are up-to-date with what consumers want or need; they also provide equipment for demos so potential customers can see how great your products work! Sales enablement - the key to success for PMMs is providing customers with a seamless experience from the start asking throughout their buying cycle. Multiple sales enablement assets help achieve this, including pitch decks, competitive battle cards, and training docs/videos. These sales enablement assets will ultimately drive the win-loss ratio and improve the conversion rate of the funnel.PMMs are the brains behind campaigns, shaping and directing them annually. They also educate marketing organizations on what kind of campaign is needed for their industry or market segmentation strategy so that campaigns can appropriately execute it with maximum effectiveness.The campaigns run by PMMs throughout the year are shaped and directed to educate marketing managers on why they need certain kinds of advertising. The people who drive these initiatives in the market, called “Campaign Runners,” should understand how it all fits together so that there’s no confusion or disagreement with decisions being made internally as well among other outside agencies/partnerships when working towards a common goal.Launch planning is an essential part of product marketing. Product marketing is often the quarterback for launches. They help determine how many launches can be accomplished in a year and whether they’re organized enough with proper communication between cross-functional teams involved in the launch. Did the launch reach the right target audience? Did the launch successfully achieve the planned user adoption?Supporting the analyst community is crucial to the success of any company. However, analyst events are a considerable commitment, but they’re worth it when you see your team grow in size and expertise! Does the analyst understand the product positioning and consider you a thought leader?Events: We have supported countless user conferences, tradeshows, and keynotes. It is one way we help our clients connect with their audience so they can share knowledge or demo new products in person!" }, { "title": "Effective Product Launch plan - The Ultimate step by step Guide", "url": "/articles/effective-product-launch/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-09-02 12:39:00 +0530", "snippet": "Effective Product Launch plan: The Ultimate step by step Guide Effective Product Launch plan: The Ultimate step by step Guide What is a Product Launch, and how is it different from a Go-To-Market Strategy?

It feels so satisfying; nothing can compare in terms of excitement or pride about how far everyone has come together towards one goal: delivering happiness through our workLaunching a new product is no easy feat. There are many different aspects that need attention, not only in engineering but also marketing and sales strategies to name just three key stakeholders involved with this process - you’re at the epicenter of it all! As someone who works closely alongside our company’s vision-driven leaders day after day; one thing I know about creating seamless launches comes naturally when handling such complex tasks on your own time or as part of an internal team effort: understanding what needs doing from start (defining features) through finish lineIn this blog post we will walk you through a step-by-step guide on how to launch your product like a pro! We’ll cover everything from market research to creating a launch plan, so you can make sure your product hits the ground running.What is a Product Launch, and how is it different from a Go-To-Market Strategy?Before we delve deep into Product Launch, let us clearly distinguish between Product Launch and Go To Market Strategy.Many people use the terms “go-to-market (GTM) strategy” and “product launch” interchangeably.A go-to-market (GTM) strategy is a package of measures businesses take to bring a new product or service to market. A typical GTM approach includes target audience profiles, a marketing plan, and a concrete sales and distribution plan to minimize the risk of bringing a new product to market. Understanding the difference between a product launch and a GTM strategy is vital for product marketers. And making sure that everyone in your company understands it can help them better understand the function of product marketing.The product launch strategy is the segment of a GTM strategy exclusively focused on releasing the completed product to the public. To make sure your target audience hears about your new product, a successful launch employs multiple departments, from marketing and sales to customer support, customer success, and documentation teams, to disseminate information engagingly.This blog assumes you have done your market research, know your competitive landscape, and have a go-to-market (GTM)  strategy.What is a Product Launch Plan?A successful product launch strategy aims to ensure that your business stakeholders and everyone in your distribution channels know about the new launch. As a result, the above product launch stakeholders are equipped with information to take advantage of this opportunity for revenue generation. Further, your potential customers in the lower end of the funnel understand the Unique selling proposition, Value proposition, and how that benefits their lives.Types of Product Launch A brand new product or a major (or Tier 1) release:  includes net new functionality that will be significant for the top of your funnel (i.e., announcing an entirely new feature set that is fundamental to your product’s value proposition). This might be the first time you validate your market research Minor Release  (or Tier 2): To ensure your customer retention by providing minor features and bug fixes reported by them. Products and services of all kinds (not just consumer goods) must maintain value. Therefore, product marketers must constantly adjust what they offer while staying competitive in ever-changing markets like e-commerce or tech. This might be a soft launch unlike the tier 1 launch which is usually a hard launch. Updates or Patch releases(or Tier 3):  are designed to support the product platform’s stability and security to ensure it is compliant with the latest standards defined within your organization. These updates would mostly be within the company unless there is a significant vulnerability, and every customer has to be updated to avoid any security breach. The customer success team notifies the respective customers.The template I’ve developed and shared below is geared toward a major or a new launch (Tier 1 launch) since these are the ones that need the most planning, coordination, and effort. The template includes all the techniques a product marketing team may utilize to launch this scale and the necessary timeframes for executing each.Why is the Product Launch Plan essential?Creating Cohesion and Clarity in the Team: A  Product launch plan typically involves anywhere from 20-50 stakeholders. Lack of clarity can quickly derail the launch in terms of time, money, and effort. However, with a solid Product Launch Plan, everyone is up to speed on what the goal and metrics of the  launch are, consequently what the priorities are,  what their contribution is going to be, how it will impact the downstream launch activities, and the end goal, their deadlines and whom to reach out to for help and collaboration when required.  Reducing costs: With a solid product launch strategy, you can keep marketing expenditures low by determining the right promotional channels with the greatest return on investment (ROI) and creating positioning, marketing messaging, and, consequently, content that will resonate with your target audience in the chosen channels. With a clear goal and timeframe, it is also possible to trim the fat of infinite activity and stick to those tasks that will add to the goal’s success in mind!Reducing time to market: More and more product teams in the tech space have started with agile development. With the proper planning and coordination, the Product marketing team should be able to get an early demo and start planning for some of the materials like positioning and messaging before going to market.What do you need to get started for a successful product launch?Ensure Go-To-Market Strategy is in PlaceYou should hopefully have a wealth of information at your fingertips. In the best-case scenario, you should have interviewed multiple customers and dug into the interviews for fresh insights to put together the following. an informed value proposition and positioning foundation segmentation to know who you’re selling to your buyers’ personas are clearly defined[b][c] The customer journey mapping out how they buy If there’s anything left undone before the launch, then take some time to prep yourself, so you are all set for the successful launch.Possible Stakeholders, their Roles &amp; ResponsibilitiesExecuting a successful product launch requires involving all the right people. In most cases, that will include but is not limited to the below departments::Product Marketing: The marketing team is usually at the forefront of launching a new product. They work with other departments to craft an engaging strategy and connect those who are involved in it all along the wayProduct team: Throughout the product life cycle, the product marketing and the product management team have to work hand in hand to be on the same page with the release deliverables. Hence the people designing the product are a crucial part of the launch team. They have a profound understanding of their work and can make improvements based on early feedback from other stakeholders!Sales: Your sales team is vital in helping you understand the audience you want to reach, identifying the best people to contact for beta testing, and getting your first customers to buy. Also, the PMM team will be working with them to develop sales enablement updates for the specific released features.Marketing: After creating a public announcement, your digital marketing team will work with the PR department or agency to get the right media coverage. They’ll also help you change your message based on how well it’s received at first. The marketing plan is owned by this team.Documentation Team: Your documentation team has a crucial role in onboarding your users smoothly and painlessly to the new version and helping them utilize the value provided by the improvements you bring to the table. Usually, this will be covered by the product management, but having them as a stakeholder will help you have clarity on the current status and enable a faster iteration cycle.  Partners Team: If you have a Partners Services Team (like integration partners, marketing partners, distribution partners), they usually have to release their addons/integrations in tandem. So, they must be at the table and part of the conversation.Customer Service: If you have a  customer service team, ensure they are part of these stakeholders. They should be looped in early and provided all the product information they need to do their jobs effectively.   They will have to    Ensure customers have a positive experience with our new release.    Be prepared to field questions and provide support about the  product/release,    know where to direct random questions and feedback.Customer Support/Customer Success Team: Like the customer service team, the customer success team should be involved early and give all the information, a demo deep dive, and training. They usually Try the use cases their customers use and see if there are any changes in the usability that the customer has to be notified of or if it has to be fixed in the product. identify which of their assigned customers will reap benefits from the new changes and effectively present them to them. By communicating the exact benefits each customer can obtain, they can effectively generate interest around the launch among existing customers. This sets the stage for further increasing the number of seats or upselling and cross-selling.Executives - Their buy-in is crucial for the success of every launch. They will also be heavily involved in setting the goal and metrics for the launch.Set Product Launch GoalsIt ultimately boils down to revenue. However, revenue consists of a lot of moving parameters. You can’t measure revenue if you’re in an industry that releases new products frequently, so it’s best to focus on current launch metrics like retention rates and changes in TOFU/MOFU/BOFUSome metrics for retention can be changes in parameters like Are the users able to use the new features in question effectively (Product Engagement), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Customer Retention Rate (CRR) and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score. User retention is a cost-effective strategy for any business looking to grow their bottom line. Keeping your customers happy not only helps you keep more of them, but also increases the overall value in both old and new clients by keeping all parties satisfied with each other’s service or product offerings!top-of-funnel(ToFu) content that gets the most attention is the content that resonates with the customers. This is the content that is likely to be shared and talked about. When you do this, you can help to create a buzz around your brand. This will help to build awareness for your brand.Middle-of Funnel(MoFu) content is designed to educate the audience and move them from awareness, through consideration, into conversion. Some of this material may be positioned for people who want more information on an actionable item like making a purchase or signing up with your email list; these should help quantifiable metrics such as return visitors/social media followers that indicate potential customer interest in progressing further along those pathsBottom-of Funnel metrics measure the success of your marketing campaign by tracking conversions from users who land on an online page. These can include details such as sales, repeat purchases and demo requests to see how satisfied customers are with their purchase or experience before converting them into SQLs (someone that’s made a real decision). One of the ways to measure is to see the ratio of people who convert from MQL to SQL.How to collect MetricsIdentifying which metrics you’ll need to use to measure your product launch’s success is essential. Here are examples of metrics to look out for: Top of the funnel(ToFU) metrics can be as below Using metrics can help you better understand your customer’s behavior towards your product. This information will help you determine what is leading them towards your product. There are many tools you can use to measure how your website is doing. Some of them include Google Analytics,  LinkedIn Insight Tag  and Google AdWords. If you are looking for how to boost the conversion rate, you need to look at the bounce rate. The use of analytics to gain knowledge about your audience allows you to understand more about your demographic, geographical location, and what kind of users are using your app / website. track click through rate from Google searches. Analytics is useful in helping you understand how people are engaging with your content so that you can optimize for the best engagement. It’s useful for understanding where your audience lives, what they’re interested in, etc. Further you can google cohort analysis to understand their behavior to optimize your site. Some of the content which converts at this stage are Blog posts, Videos, Podcasts Guides, Ebooks, Infographics Some of the metrics you can measure Number of public-facing content uploaded Blog posts, Infographics, Videos, Podcasts, Guides and Ebooks. Avg visitors Clickthrough rate from google Number of newsletter subscription Number of downloads for guides and ebooks Middle of the funnel(MoFU) metics Metrics at this stage is to understand what is working for your customers and identify which content is not optimal. In other words, what converts to the next stage of the funnel. Your focus should be on repeat visitors, engagement rates for the content you have created. Finally there’s social media sharing data which shows whether consumers are taking time out of their day to share something via Facebook. Some of the content which converts at this stage are Case studies, Original research and reports Templates, Checklists, Product tips and tutorials Events, Webinars Some of the metrics you can measure Repeat visitors Engagement rate vs bounce rate Clickthrough rate. Number of people registering/attending events and webinars. Conversion rate for prospects who attended the events and webinar Conversion rate from the emails obtained from the newsletter. Number of social media shares for specific content. You can use a url shortener like bit.ly or Sites like sharedcount.com provide you with such information. Bottom of the funnel(BoFU) metics At this stage the metrics should help you understand how to improve sales and revenue. If your metrics show that the majority of customers are satisfied, but not engaged enough to make a purchase or convert into leads for you then there might be something going on in terms of how they’re using the product. If you offer a service, are there repeat customers, if not how to improve it.  Monitor the conversion rate of demos turned into purchases. Some of the content which converts at this stage are Product demos by sales Product tutorials, Video product walk-throughs, Product webinars Detailed case studies Calculators, Free Tools Comparison charts Some of the metrics you can measure Win/loss rate Number of Signups or trials User Retention: How will the launch impact your user retention and customer lifetime value? Churn Rate: Will your product launch reduce the number of people who leave your platform?

By tracking these numbers, you’ll see your launch’s success and what areas need improvement.Launch SequencePre-launch steps:Finalize the productMake sure to finalize  on the features/improved product that will be shipped on the day of the launch. Coordinate with the product team to identify the feature list and a probable date when the feature is frozen for the release with a date for the demo for the rest of the stakeholders you will identify next.Identify your stakeholdersOnce you have a list of features from product team, the next step is to prepare a list of stakeholders and their responsibilities The stakeholder can be from different departments like marketing, product, sales, documentation, customer service, customer success, etc.Once you’ve gathered the right information, you can schedule a kick off meeting with stakeholders. This will help you to have a common understanding about your product.Kick-Off Meeting The kickoff meeting agenda could have the following A quick presentation or a read-out of the list of features which will be launched with this product. This will align the stakeholders and what can be expected out of this launch. See if you can talk about the positioning or messaging to be used for this launch. This information can also be passed on at a later meeting if you wish so. Read out the responsibility of each stakeholder, this might involve a specific set of deliverables from his/her team. Create a product launch checklist to make sure you identify dependencies and what order you need to perform tasks Get the delivery date for each of the items to be delivered by them. PMM Role is very loose and is very different in each organization. So, make sure your role in this launch schedule clearly so that you set expectations up front. Identify a regular cadence for meeting with the stakeholders.  Call this a product launch status meeting As the team wishes it could be mail communication initially and probably close to a launch, it could be a short 10 min face to face status meeting to get all of them on the same page. During the meeting talk about the progress made for the week and what to expect next week. Also do a round table to understand what each one of the stakeholders is working on(if they have a deliverable). If they have any bottlenecks. If there are any bottlenecks escalate it to the appropriate people to get it resolved. The most critical parameters of the launch and get team buy in Create a product launch checklist to make sure you identify dependencies and what order you need to perform tasks Workout the messaging and positioning around the productSometimes, the messaging and positioning might not change much and must be massaged a little to accommodate the new product. However, in other cases where new features make significant contributions to value, the product marketing team will have the joy of coming up with new messaging and positioning to introduce the customers to the powerful value proposition the product brings to the market.Product PackagingPrice: Adding new features often changes the balance of value and price. In this case, the product price might have to be adjusted. Usually, existing customers will be given advanced communication about changes, or they will be grandfathered into the old plan, and new customers will be provided with the new planProduct/Website ChangesLanding Page: The product’s landing pages, pricing, and feature pages will have to be revamped. Often the focus of the pages changes to the new features being launched.In-Product Tours, Guides, and Hints: Many software products nowadays take advantage of workflow-aligned hints and guides to introduce customers to new features, help them learn how to use a product interactively, and increase engagement. It is crucial to ensure these hints and guides are adapted appropriately for the workflow of new and existing customersMake sure the website’s look and feel align with any positioning changes. Also, check for screenshots and other product-related resources that are updated.Create an Engaging Pitch Deck To persuade stakeholders and executives, you’ll need to create a detailed pitch deck that covers everything the launch will entail. The deck’s purpose is to help explain your vision and strategy behind the product launch plan so that people will want to invest in it. Here are some tips for creating an engaging pitch deck: Goal of this product launch, why it was chosen, and how it connected to the company’s overall GTM strategy. Check if there is any feedback from the stakeholders on the goal. Talk about how the launch will add value to the Value proposition and how this is going to be messaged to the users and prospects Talk about the benefits of the features released during this launch. Communicate Visually: Work with the launch team to set a date and time for the launch and communicate it to stakeholders. Using a timeline diagram to communicate visually can bring greater clarity Leverage Tools Such as Canva: You can craft a beautiful pitch deck without being a design expert. To streamline the process, consider using tools like Canva that include templates specifically for pitch decks. Projections of Forecasted Revenue and Results: Executives love data, so your pitch should include projected revenue and results. This way, they can understand how launching your product will impact revenue and company growth. 4-8 Slides: Keep your pitch deck short- only 4 to 8 slides. This will make it more digestible for your audience.Based on the positioning and the promotional channels you plan to engage with for the latest feature/benefits to create a buzz, have a detailed plan worked out for generating the content, script, and other materials required to make things like blog posts, videos, infographics, and other resources. You may have to do this yourself or work with the respective teams to get this ready ahead of the launch date. Define tasks for each item and have a deadline associated with each item.The above content might have to be published before the launch to create awareness. So have a calendar of events when each resource is posted on the respective social media channels. You may have to do this yourself or work with the respective teams to get this ready ahead of the launch date.Identify the PR agency you will work with or if you plan to do it yourself. Identify the platforms where your users/prospects hang out and work with these platforms to do media coverage of the product. You may want to create an announcement that will be used for media coverage and publish it on your website. For example, there are many press release platforms, such as producthunt.com, newswire.com, presswire.com, and service.prweb.com, where you can spread the word about your release and draw the attention of potential usersIdentify the list of blogs that need to be in place during the launch, which talks about the use cases that will be implemented as part of this launch. Perform keyword research to see what aspects you need to cover as part of the blog so that you can drive organic traffic. Identify a title that answers the questions your customer usually wants answers to. In the recent past, more than long-form content, users have looked for a short visual representation of ideas. So check if the same content can be converted into an infographic so that it can be shared on Twitter,  linked, Facebook and Instagram.If your potential users are on social media, then it would be ideal to gain momentum using social media influencers. At best, you can set up some interviews with them so that you reach the whole set audience identify influencers in your product area and see if they can become your Brand advocates. Here are some tools that will help you find the right influencers for your market segment upfluence.com, www.creatoriq.com, aspire.io, dovetale.com, and others. Reach out to them to check their availability, and they are willing to promote your brand. Check if they are open for an interview after your launch date. Plan/prepare the questionnaire/script which will be used for the interviewCreate resources to be consumed by your customers and prospects. The assumption is that you have a go-to-market(GTM) plan in place and a product roadmap that adheres to it. This means that before deciding on the feature set, you have already worked with the product management team to perform a user analysis to validate your priority items needed by customers and competitive gaps to be filled. From this perspective, Work with the product team to develop the benefits for each feature with respect to the positioning decided in GTM. Based on the above, identify if there are any messaging changes to be done Work with the sales team and update the battle cards with the latest features. Update the gaps it fixes, and the value customers will get from the latest features.Create demos for sales that accommodate the new features and benefits. From the product team, understand the data required to showcase the new features implemented. Request them for a demo setup with the required data. Come up with a demo/presentation script that will showcase the value created by the product. Setup your product with appro BasedPlan for Sales enablement training sessions. Based on the demo content, showcase the workflow to demonstrate the feature. If you are not a technical person, work with the product person to make this demo happen. In some organizations, there might be an on-demand demo environment for sales demos and trial customers. Update the prerequisite data in these environments so that the feature is demonstrable in those environmentsDemo for Customer support and Customer success. (These can be combined with sales enablement demos if planned accordingly) Work with customer support/success teams to identify the first few customers who might be adopting these new features. From this list of work, customer success can identify prospective customers who would offer testimonials—plan to capture these testimonials on your website. In some cases, the feature might not be publicly available yet. In those cases, there might be a need to find beta testers or early adopter programs. In addition, you might have to work with customer support/success to identify potential candidates and check if they are interested.Identify email content that must be sent to the customers on the launch day. It should have links to all resources about the launch like Documentation for the new features demo video of the new features, If they want to have an in-person demo on how to register for it, Bugs that got fixed and Known bugs(if this is permitted in your industry) how to report a bug if a feature is not working as expectedIdentify email content, reach outs, and documentation required for partners. The first step is identifying the type of reach or documentation necessary for each partner. For example, an influencer may need different information than an integration partner. This will help ensure the communication is tailored to the specific partner and their needs. Some of your potential partners could be Influencers Integration Partners Products and Extensions built on your API Co promoters Distributors AffiliatesPlan your awareness ad campaigns and social media outreach programs Content, graphics, and videos should be in place before the campaign. Plan for an appropriate call to action for these programs. It could be signing up for your newsletters, following your social media handles, etc Some of these awareness campaigns might have to be done before the launch, so plan accordingly. If this is the first time you are doing this, then you need to set up your social media accounts the right way so that your handle looks like an authoritative one for people to sign up for.Launch Day Day before the launch, conduct a Go/No-Go meeting with all the stakeholders to see if we are all set. On the day of launch, coordinate with the stakeholders to perform the sequence of activities, from releasing the doc and actual product to the public to whatever you have identified. verify if the trial workflow, product, or addon download workflow works as expected before you start any of the campaigns Inform the stakeholders about the release in the slack channel Make a company-wide announcement about the release, so everyone is on the same page. Additionally, keep track of the launch’s data, such as the number of inquiries received, total sales made, and the number of returns processed.Post-launch Retarget prospects who expressed interest but didn’t convert. Solicit user feedback and testimonials on your website  to use for future promotion Make efforts to have customers tell others about your new product release by word of mouth. Prospects trust the opinions of their friends, making it an effective method for gaining more consumers through referrals. plan to have a webinar for your customers to showcase the latest features and benefits and get feedback from them. Talk about early adoption programs in this webinar to get interested customers. Evaluate how the launch went by comparing your findings to your objectives. Examine how well the launch succeeded based on your data and the previous metrics you’ve gathered before it. Post-launch, conduct a retrospective meeting to understand from the team if any improvements can be implemented before the next product launch. Inform the stakeholders about the release in the slack channelConclusionA product launch is not about driving traffic for sales. It is a well-coordinated, cohesive force between various cross-functional teams. Giving transparency and clarity among the multiple stakeholders who help you clearly articulate the value delivered by your product to your users and prospects. Content or the right part of the funnel will lead to success by making the users happy.As Archimedes once said, “Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world .”Product launch is a fulcrum; having all cross-functional teams coordinate their effort towards this will deliver tremendous success." }, { "title": "Competitive-Intelligence - A Comprehensive Guide", "url": "/articles/competitive-intelligence/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-09-02 12:39:00 +0530", "snippet": "Competitors of different feathers Do we need Competitive Intelligence?

It helps set the tone for many other roles and it’s not hard to see why this position would be so important in any company looking towards success! From product positioning, messaging, product launches, sales collateral creation to aiding customer retention the influence is felt across the board. Work starts first with planning then onto execution through campaigns that target customers right down to implementing pricing strategies–the list goes on forever really but you get my drift…Do we need Competitive Intelligence?Whether you’re just starting out or have been in the market for a long time, it’s important to always be aware of industry trends. The spaghetti monster of yoreThere are often two camps of thought when it comes to competitive intelligence: The one that watches the competition closely and mirrors their changes, lest they gain an advantage. This can lead into a “spaghetti monster”, a hodge podge of features from all your competitors and at the same time your product is just too similar to other products to differentiate.The second believes their strategy should not be defined by competition, only by customer voice. Yet, to work without thinking about how this may compare with existing products out there, is throwing caution to the winds and being blissfully unaware until competition hits you in the face.Actually, there is a more nuanced third stance: One cannot drive a car forward looking into the rear view mirror, but it is still important to know where the other vehicles are on the road to stay safe and stay ahead.You could be the market leader, or could have positioned yourself as the big fish of a small pond. It is important to know when competition is expanding into your territory or inching into your niche. There is the reason for market pioneers often not being the market leaders. Competition copies the same innovation they do and do it better because of insights gained from seeing the pioneer doing it first.Goals of Competitive AnalysisCompetitive analysis is an exercise backed by a goal in mind. It has a huge set of potential actions and launching into Competitive Intelligence without a goal is a surefire way to burn your time and money. If you are getting into a new market, the goal can be completely different from an existing product. Here are some possible goals Entering New Markets: One of the most important things to do before entering into new markets is analysis of competitors. This will allow you know what they are up against, their strengths and weaknesses etc., which can help with your own product/service launch strategy Market Suitability : How can you know if your business is still the best choice in its niche market? A strategic analysis of competitors by looking at their products, services, prices and more helps understand where you stand apart from others within this niche and how relevant you still are to your market. Customer Segmentation: Which customer segments are your competitors targeting? What types of customers gravitate toward each different competitor in the market? Competitor Discovery: find aspiring competitors which can become your direct counterparts in the future.Your goals may differ from one Competitive Analysis session to another, but it is important to go into the session after deciding on the goal to ensure your time is used effectively and not lost in the sea of exploration and possibilities that is Competitive Intelligence.Choosing your competitors: Divide and ConquerSo you sit down to list all your competitors, only to find what you expected to be a list of 5 competitors expanding on and on to 30 and beyond. Oh the horror! What now? Obviously trying to track 30 competitors is an exercise in futility.The solution is to find an efficient way to split your time amongst them. All competitors are not equal.Direct CompetitorsThere are some who compete for the same target audience as you and have a rather similar product. So they position, message and price very close to you. These are direct competitors and need to be checked on regularly.You can find them from your existing customers, ask them which companies they were evaluating before deciding on your own. Your sales people will also be a great source of information on this as they will often have to field questions about direct competitors.Your customer success people can also identify the most dangerous competitors as that is where your most of your churned customers will move to.Indirect CompetitorsThese are competitors who are not direct threats but could potentially change tactics or target market to occupy your market. Who provide alternative ways to solve your customer problem. Eg. Netflix and Youtube. One relies on monthly subscription and consistent format and high quality content. Youtube relies on ad revenue and independent content creators with hit or miss quality. Who provide a similar product but targeted at a different audience e.g Netflix and Curiosity Stream. Both are monthly subscription and consistent format and high quality content but the former is geared towards entertainment, Curiosity Stream is focused on the edutainment focused market through streaming documentaries.While you need not follow them obsessively, you need to be aware of any directional changes in strategy and positioning that might cause incursion into or overlap with your market.Indirect competitors would be a higher number than direct competitors, at 10 or higher. This is the group you will monitor periodically, once a month or once a quarter.Distant CompetitorsThese are competitors who have a long way to go before being able to position themselves as a viable alternative to you. They are usually months or years behind and do not pose an immediate threat, but someone to keep an eye on for the future. Sometimes, startups optimized for growth with huge investment backing can narrow the gap much faster and hence their financial details should be on your radar.Their number will vary based on how you define distant competitors for your usecase. They will need to be assessed every 6 months or so and if necessary added to one of the above categories.Segmenting your Competitors - A complete listWhile in the above description, we have used the most important aspects of your competitors to classify, there are others ways to group your competitors Target Persona(s) Target Companies/Market Segment Messaging and Positioning Competitor Organization Size Geographic Coverage Distribution channels Pricing Policy Capacity &amp; Utilization Integrations and PartnershipsSources for Discovering Competitors Voice of customer and prospects. The best sources are your sales people and customer success team. If a prospect is evaluating your product versus another, the other product is definitely a direct competitor. Same goes for when an existing customer is considering renewal of your product or switching to another product.The following lists of companies will be approximate estimations for competitors and you will need to use your judgement to decide if they truly are one. Alternatives to X - alternativeto.net is still the best source to get a less biased view of what is viewed as competitors in the market for X. The advantage of alternativeto is, it covers open source and free tools too. Other sources are review sites like G2 reviews, stackshare.io etc. https://alternativeto.net/software/airtable https://www.g2.com/products/airtable/competitors/alternatives Semrush.com - If you even get a trickle of prospects from your website, semrush.com is worth checking out. It shows the sites that are ranking for the same keyword as you are. It also shows the level of overlap between the two sites. It is often a good source for discovering indirect competitors. Similarweb.com - It shows sites that are similar to yours. The algorithm for calculating this is not very clear and it often is hit or miss, but a source for discovering tangential, distant competitors.Choosing a competitive analysis FrameworkThe goal of any framework is to help you be more mindful about the decisions and actions that impact your business.If you are an entrepreneur or a startup founder, then it will help you assess the value proposition of your product. If you are a product marketing professional then it will help you identify which market positioning will work best for your product. If you are a product marketer, then both of the above statements might be true for you.There are multiple frameworks to give structure to your competitive analysis. You can choose the ones that fulfil your objective. In time, you will be able to adapt these frameworks to something unique and customized for you.The process of competitive analysis can give you a wealth of data both quantitative (Numbers) as well qualitative(Data). Organized well, it  will make things easier for future campaigns by giving clear direction(and a competitive edge) on which strategy works best based on this information gathered during each one!Competitive Analysis Frameworks1: Identify the variables that can influence the marketPorter’s five forces analysis: is a way to help you understand the competitive structure of your industry by looking at five factors: new entrants, buyers (or customers) suppliers Substitutes Rivalry amongst competitorsThe first four forces will all affect each other as well as how much pressure there’s from rivalry among competitors in an area overall- this means that one factor can have many impacts on different parts within it depending what else happens with those aspects throughout time. For example, if a single supplier is the only source for a key part, the supplier can drive prices of raw material high.For example, Intel was the dominant chip manufacturer for a long time. Hence all high end laptop manufacturers were dependent on Intel for pricing. The advent of highly improved and revamped AMD processors saw a decrease in prices and increase in processing power. On the other hand, shortage in electronics following Covid again resulted in high prices. Thus, A Five Forces analysis may help businesses gauge the competitiveness of their industry, evaluate how trends will influence industry competition and how to position oneself for success.2: Identify Direct Competitors with Strategic Group AnalysisYou might have already gotten a list of competitors and grouped them into direct, indirect, distant or not-a-competitor already. So why should you do Strategic Group Analysis? The following exercise helps you verify your decisions and illustrate visually the competitor landscape that is understandable for everyone. It also helps identify shifts in the market It is easy to understand how the company can move into a more lucrative part of the market        Once you have a sizable list of competitors (at least 5), you need to identify the attribute(s) that meaningfully differentiates the competitors into groups. This can be something unique to your market (e.g Menu Spread, as shown in the example below) or a more standard attribute like Product quality and features Extent of product/ service diversity Number of market segments served Distribution channels Brand image Degree of vertical integration Pricing policy Competitor Organization Size Cost position Geographic coverage Capacity &amp; Utilization Target Persona(s) Target Companies/Market Segment Number of Integrations and PartnershipsNow one can sort the competitors based on the identified attributes into Strategic Groups. refered from: https://open.lib.umn.edu/strategicmanagement/chapter/3-5-mapping-strategic-groups/)3: Analyse your direct competitors SWOT analysis :  A SWOT analysis is a powerful tool that businesses can use to gain a competitive advantage. The acronym stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. By identifying these four key areas, businesses can develop strategies to improve their position in the marketplace. One of the main strengths of a SWOT analysis is that it forces businesses to take a close look at their competitor’s operations. By understanding their competitor’s strengths and weaknesses, businesses can develop strategies to either exploit their weaknesses or protect against their strengths. In addition, a SWOT analysis can help businesses to identify opportunities in the marketplace that they may not have otherwise noticed. Finally, by understanding the threats facing their business, companies can develop plans to mitigate these risks.In short, a SWOT analysis is an essential tool for any business that wants to stay ahead of the competition. By taking the time to understand their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as those of their competitors, businesses can develop actionable plans to improve their position in the marketplace.4: Analyzing your product’s position against CompetitorsPerceptual MappingAs marketing strategies continue to evolve, so too does the need for accurate and reliable consumer research. Perceptual mapping is a powerful tool that can help marketers to understand the perceptions of their customers or potential customers. By visually displaying the perceived positions of products, product lines, brands, or companies, perceptual maps provide valuable insights into consumer attitudes and preferences. In addition to helping marketers to understand where the consumer ranks their company in terms of characteristics and in comparison to competing companies, perceptual maps can also help to identify areas of opportunity. When creating a new product, for example, a company should look for a space that is currently unoccupied by competitors and that has a high concentration of consumer desire (ideal points). By using perceptual mapping to guide their decision-making, companies can ensure that they are making informed choices that are based on sound market research.https://courses.lumenlearning.com/waymakerintromarketingxmasterfall2016/chapter/reading-the-positioning-process/5: Analysing a Company with Multiple ProductsThe Growth-Share Matrix, also known as the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix, is a tool used by businesses to help them assess their different products and make informed decisions about investments. The matrix looks at two main variables - relative market share and market growth rate - in order to classify products into one of four categories: Stars, Question Marks, Cash Cows or Dogs.Stars are products with high market share and high growth rate. They require significant investment in order to maintain their position but can generate a lot of cash flow. Question Marks are products with low market share but high growth rate. They require significant investment in order to grow their market share and become profitable. Cash Cows are products with high market share but low growth rate. They generate a lot of cash flow but don’t require much investment. Dogs are products with low market share and low growth rate. They have little potential for growth and generate very little cash flow.By understanding where each of their products fall on the matrix, businesses can make strategic decisions about where to allocate their resources in order to maximize their return on investment. For example, a company might choose to invest more heavily in a ‘Star’ product which has high growth potential but low market share. This could involve increasing advertising or innovating the product. On the other hand, a ‘Cash Cow’ might be a product with high market share but low growth potential. In this case, a company might choose to milk the product for as long as possible before eventually phasing it out. The Growth-Share Matrix is therefore an essential tool for any business looking to make informed decisions about investments.Gathering Data about your Competitors1: CompanyThere are various metrics, both essential and secondary, that you can use to gauge your competitor’s business. You can break those down into sections like customer base, revenue, funding details, and other general information.The former may be as simple as filling out data on your competitors’ number of employees, their C-suite executives’ names, etc. via sources such as LinkedIn or CrunchBase, while metrics like revenue are more difficult to discover.To learn more about a company’s revenue and customers, begin by searching for their names alongside “revenue” or “customers.” If that doesn’t work, you might try a business directory like Dun &amp; Bradstreet.Sources About Us page on competitor’s website - Often you can the location, the key people in the company and funding information here. Crunchbase - You can find information about when a company was started, who are the key people, the number of funding rounds and fundng amount, what are the other companies in the space. While you can get a ballpark estimate of how big the company is, it is often inaccurate. The same goes for employee information LinkedIn - You can find all the locations the company exists in, the number of employees, recent hires, job postings etc. If you have the paid account, you can also find how many they have hired of late. Paid services like Dun &amp; Bradstreet GlassDoor - Gives an idea of what the culture is at the competitor company and how aligned they are. When a company’s culture is in trouble, the agility of their progress is greatly hindered.2: Products and servicesUnderstanding the products or services that your competitors offer is the key to finding market differentiation for your brand. The first thing you’ll need to do is answer a few basic qualitative questions: What are your competitors selling? What is their USP? What key features are offered? What technology are they using? Most of this information can likely be found on their website, but you should also consult their LinkedIn posts, job ads, and tools like BuiltWith to fill in any gaps.After that, you can move on to more quantitative details around price. Questions to answer here include: How much does their product cost? Is that more or less than your closest equivalent? Is it a subscription or a one-off fee? Do your competitors offer more packages than you?SourcesTech Used Builtwith.com - Builtwith is biased more towards the customer facing tech you find in frontend. This can still be very useful, depending on what you are looking for. This is a good source to know what webserver they are using, the analytics solution used, frontend tech, CDNs etc. Website Career page - To deep dive into tech that the competitors use in the backend, the jobs listed on their careeer page would be an ideal source. Even more importantly, new job postings will be leading indicators of new features that the competitor would be building. For example: An Job Advert for SAP developer could indicate SAP integration is in their future plans. Linkedin Job Posts - In addition to the same advantages confered by visitng the Website Career page indicated above, you can also see when the job was posted, giving a timeline information Patents filed - This is an important source of upcoming innovation for companies in hardcore tech, manufacturing tech, FMCG, oil and gas, and Energy companies.Product features Website Product Page - For a B2B product targeted at small and medium businesses, The product pages usually have a complete list of features that a competitor team wants the customer to know. Sometimes, there will be multiple pages targeted at different user personas, which makes it much easier to know what personas are being targeted. Youtube Demo Videos - The name says it all. Often one can find demo of the products put up by the company themselves on their own site or on Youtube. It is also possible to find users/influencers posting their own videos and take on the product. This can be a treasure trove of information on what is truly possible with a product (as opposed to Website Product Page, where the narrative is strongly controlled), what innovative features are present and what is absent. Review sites like G2 - When all else fails, review sites like G2, Capterra and forums like Reddit are great sources of information on what features delight customers, what frustrates them and what is the role of the customer using the product.Pricing Policy Pricing Page - Some product pages have transperant pricing policy. In such cases, you get all the information you need from the Pricing pages itself. Ex-Customers - When there is no clear pricing on the page, ex-customers who have chosen your product could be good source of information. Vice-versa, if one of your non-renewal customers is moving to the competitor, you could ask them for a favour and have a short exit interview covering their current frustrations and information about the product they are migrating to. Review sites like G2 - G2 sometimes has the information as provided by some of the reviewing customers. Googling “How much does x cost” - When all else fails, Google can deliver. It is possible to find some discussion on forums (usually reddit) by the competitors users and prospects about the pricing.3: Target market and customer awarenessIt’s only really by tracking a range of competitors that you can apply meaning and context to the results your brand sees. Social listening can also help you learn what customers are saying about your competitors and whether they’re listening. It’s also useful to see what kind of things your competitors are saying on their social channels – and on which ones. For instance, if your competitor is posting more on say, TikTok than LinkedIn, then you can make an educated assumption that they’re probably looking to attract a younger audience. Whom are your competitors trying to sell to? Is it the same kind of customer your own company wants to attract? And, importantly, is it working? You can get a decent handle on that last question by monitoring both share of customer voice and sentiment. Most social listening and competitor analysis tools will be able to track this for you. How does your competitor’s share of voice or sentiment rankings stack up to yours?Sources Customer Interviews (Incoming and Churning) Prospect Interviews - Your prospects are probably speaking to multiple companies before fixing on one. They will have the most up to date information Sales People Intel - Your sales people are probably the first to hear of a new competitor. They are constantly interacting with prospects are often posed with questions about how your product stands against a competitor’s. Social Media Monitoring Discussions on forums like StackOverflow, Reddit, Quora - Ideally you should also have an account on these forums where your customers/prospects hang out to be able to participate in the conversation, and if possible steer it favourably. Customer Complaint Forums - If one exists for your category, it can be rich source of objections to your competitor products.4: Marketing strategyThe meta-information around the above line of inquiry can help you fill in a few more blanks, too. For example, you’ll learn the geographical markets your competitor is focussed on alongside which ones they aren’t, and you’ll soon develop a full picture of their online presence as it relates to their target market.But beyond that, a vital part of competitor analysis is in examining direct and indirect competitors’ marketing strategies as a whole. And there are many areas to dive into:AdvertisingAlongside TV and other traditional ATL advertising, it’s helpful to use competitor analysis tools to find out how (and how often) other brands are running ads online. You’ll want to see how your advertising output matches up against your rivals’ Google, YouTube, Display, Facebook, and Twitter ads.Social media and influencer marketingAs mentioned in the section above, it’s important to know where your direct competitors are focussing their efforts when it comes to social posting. Moreover, if you monitor engagement levels per platform, you’ll learn which channels it’s best for you to prioritize.Content marketingAre your competitors blogging? Do they publish thought-leadership pieces on LinkedIn? Do they make regular videos on their YouTube channel? Do they own or sponsor a podcast? Do they have courses for their target marketing? And is any of it working? Learning what others are publishing and tracking engagement can be a useful benchmarking exercise, or – again – it can highlight potential gaps in the market.SEO performanceTracking content marketing will likely lead to monitoring the SEO performance of your direct competitors. There are several online tools (like PowerSuite, Ahrefs, Rank Tracker, and SimilarWeb) that can help you find out what keywords other brands are ranking for, and how you stack up in comparison.Understanding this is crucial for adjusting your marketing strategy, to win a greater share of common search results in your industry.Lead handling Familiarize yourself with your competitors’ lead and sales process by venturing down it yourself. Watch a tutorial, book a demo, or make contact with their sales teams to see how much of the process is gated, how seamless things are, and how long responses take. Sign up for their newsletter and see how they lead prospects to their funnel. What offers are given? How long is the nurture cycle?ConclusionThe process of creating a marketing strategy is not an easy one. This process requires that you have a clear vision for why certain decisions were made. This will be a guiding light for making some tactical decisions during the course where and when you need to allocate resources to certain campaigns. So make absolutely sure it’s worth the commitment and worth all the time spent before moving forward with them!" } ]
