Create a isometric-vector scene on a solid background as if illuminated by softly glowing control panels. Render flat yellow-and-black worker bees (#ff5c35 body, #000000 stripes) wearing miniature hard hats, busily assembling three glowing dashboard modules in front of them. Each module emits a faint halo matching its icon color. Use bold outlines, simple shapes, and no gradients. Streamlined Sales Funnels Module 1 glows with an orange halo (#fb560a), featuring a stylized funnel. Bees are welding small brackets onto the funnel mouth and stacking binary-digit crates at its base. Label beneath in white (#ffffff): “Streamlined sales funnels for better lead conversion.” Reliable Integrations Module 2 glows with a teal halo (#b7ecec), showcasing interlocking puzzle pieces. Bees are bridge-bolting between pieces and scanning connection points with miniature tablets. Label beneath in white: “Reliable integrations with top platforms for seamless operations.” Efficient Onboarding Module 3 glows with a navy halo (#213343), displaying a gear-handshake icon. Bees are using tiny drill-drivers on gear teeth and guiding handshake pegs into sockets. Label beneath in white: “Efficient onboarding processes to enhance customer satisfaction.”
