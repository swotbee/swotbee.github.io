## Context for the image generation

This image is part of a larger workflow representing the full Swotbee CRM consulting process. The overall workflow sequence is:  
Customer Onboarding → Data Integration & Health → Marketing Engagement → Lead Nurturing & Scoring → Conversion & Handoff → Sales Pipeline Optimization → Continuous Feedback & Optimization.  

This image should exclusively use the following colors, styles and elements on generating the following block:
-  **Background:** Solid #fffaf1 (yellowish-cream) only, no gradients.  
-  **Isometric Blocks:** Soft shadows, rounded corners, uniform perspective.  
-  **Bee Design:** Stylized friendly bees in two tones – #ff7c5c (warm coral) & #1b2a37 (deep navy) – same size, shape, body posture.  
-  **Flight Paths:** Dotted curved lines in #2a655b (dark teal).  
-  **Icons & Symbols:** Stroke weight consistent, color #181c62 (federal blue).  
-  **Highlight Elements:** Bright orange #ff5c35 or #F5C400 on key items (e.g., puzzle pieces, megaphones, stars, handshake).  
-  **Layout:** Airy and breathable with generous spacing around elements.  
-  **Center Character:** A bee consultant (same design) performing the stage-specific activity, carrying or interacting with props colored per above.

This image should focus exclusively on generating the following block:

## 1. Customer Onboarding Stage

**Common Aspects:**

Foreground elements should use colors such as #70c1b3 for contrast(if needed increase darkness in the same shade). Isometric blocks should have soft shadows and rounded corners. Incorporate bee colors in two distinct tones: #ff7c5c (warm coral) and #1b2a37 (deep navy). Icons and symbols should be in a clean, consistent #181c62 federal blue . Workflow paths and bee flight lines should be rendered in colors #2a655b to maintaining clarity and harmony.

The overall composition should be airy and breathable, with generous spacing around each element to clearly distinguish them. Bees should be stylized and friendly, flying or hovering along dotted curved flight paths in the specified workflow/path colors.

**Stage Specifics:**
- Block labeled **“Customer Onboarding”** with a clipboard + gear icon in #181c62.  
- Bee consultant (warm coral body with deep navy stripes) carrying a wrench, building gears on the block.
